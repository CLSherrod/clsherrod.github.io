## From Software to Entrepreneurship: My Journey and Insights
I’m a private business owner that has sold everything from software, real estate, info-products, and the former owner of a marketing agency with a distributed team in the Philipines, Ireland, Panama, and India. I’ve been on the Internet since college in 1988. I was an early adopter of WordPress back when it was in Beta and still use it for most projects (except this website).

I’m semi-retired and now focus only on newsletter-driven educational businesses.

Since I became a full-time entrepreneur in 1996 after five years in the corporate world I’ve learned a lot from my successes and especially failures. I have written my business books and articles here to give back to the community of entrepreneurs. My early mentors helped me understand business and now its my turn to share my experience.

## Business Philosophy

## Colophon
This site is written in plain text markdown format. [My smart note system](https://christophersherrod.com/smart-notes/) are plain text markdown format files and that’s where these are articles I’ve written here start.

My plain text files are compiled using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).
