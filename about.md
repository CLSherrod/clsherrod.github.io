# Christopher Sherrod
## Retired Entrepreneur
<div style="width:20%; margin:0 auto;" align="right" markdown="1">
![Image](assets/images/avatar.webp){:.circle.shadow}
</div>I’m a retired private business owner that has sold everything from software, real estate, info-products, and the owner of a marketing agency with a distributed team in Philipines, Ireland, Panama, and India.

Since I became a full-time entrepreneur in 1996 after five years in the corporate world I’ve learned a lot from my successes and especially failures. I have written my business books and articles here to give back to the community of entrepreneurs. My early mentors helped me understand business and now its my turn to share my experience.

## Business Philosophy
Learn about my [Dolphin Entreprenuer philosophy in business](https://socapglobal.com/2017/08/forget-shark-tank-dolphin-entrepreneur-instead/) that I wrote for Social Capital Markets formally Conscious Company Magazine.

## Author
As a retired entrepreneur I enjoy writing and expat life in México.

I’ve written two business books:
- [How To Create New Business Ideas Based On What You Love](https://amzn.to/3oZlRrW)
- [Hiring Virtual Workers](https://amzn.to/2FvAxx9)

And I write a weekly newsletter for people retired in a foreign country.
