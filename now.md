## Currently Creating
- **Wilderness Tales: A Childhood in Alaska** - I’m currently going thru my photo slides collection and scanning in photos for a future book about my childhood in Alaska with float planes and wolf dogs. It’s a lot of fun seeing memories from the 70s. What an adventure I had living on a float plane lake and seeing parts of Alaska not seen by many.
- **Nan’s Love: Poems from the Heart** - I recently started writing poems for my love, family and friends for fun. Some have encouraged me to put them together into a collection. So, I’m focusing on writing about the big moments in life and getting feedback from family and friends.
- **Oracle Cards** - I’m working with an expert on creating an oracle card deck. I’m doing the art. Got the style of the cards figured out and working on completing all the cards.

## Reading
### Currently Reading
I’m reading [You Can’t Screw This Up: Why Eating Takeout, Enjoying Dessert, and Taking the Stress out of Dieting Leads to Weight Loss That Lasts by Adam Bornstein](https://amzn.to/3uTa7PT). I don’t read diet books but this one is actually really practical. Enjoying it so far.

### Last Read Books
- I read [Generative AI for Busy Business Leaders: How to Use AI With Your Team (A short book that covers simple frameworks and strategies for using gen AI at work)](https://amzn.to/436CyX3) which gave some ideas on how to implement AI into my business.
- And before that I read [Email reputation explained well: How to keep your domains’ reputation clean while growing your business, from someone who had to learn the hard way by Nicolò Rebughini](https://amzn.to/3V9gzwA) which helped me clean up my newsletter lists and increase my deliverability.
- I liked [This Book is One Page Long: A One-Page Guide that Explains Why (and How) to Write Short Nonfiction Books (Everything You Need to Know to Start Writing and Publishing Kindle Books on Amazon) by Hassan Osman](https://amzn.to/48PiiKE).

## Watched Recently
- I love watching foreign movies. A different perspective. Recently I enjoyed [Restore Point](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9362492/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) a good sci-fi movie from the Czech Republic.
- I enjoyed the show [Echo](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13966962/?ref_=rt_li_tt) and especially the ending. Being part Native American and from Oklahoma it was nice to see a tribe being represented in media. This and [Reservation Dogs](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13623580/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_8_nm_0_q_reservation%2520dogs) have made a big contribution in representation. I hope more will continue to come out.

## Enjoying My Cats
It’s been 10 months since three stray cats crawled over our wall into our compound. One was adopted out and the mother and daughter became part of the family. We were told they were unadopted because they were both a bit wild but now they are great at couch cuddling and playing. They are both welcomed members of the family.
