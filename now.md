## Writing
### Writing A Book About My Childhood In Alaska
I’m currently going thru my photo slides collection and scanning in photos for a future book about my childhood in Alaska with float planes and wolf dogs. It’s a lot of fun seeing memories from the 70s. What an adventure I had living on a float plane lake and seeing parts of Alaska not seen by many.

## Enjoying My Cats
It’s been 10 months since three stray cats crawled over our wall into our compound. One was adopted out and the mother and daughter became part of the family. We were told they were unadopted because they were both a bit wild but now they are great at couch cuddling and playing. They are both welcomed members of the family.
