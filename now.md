### Music
I’m a huge music fan. Love a lot of different styles of music. I have even created some music.
#### Musician
- I’ve been writing lyrics, which is new to me. It’s in a style that I don’t know how to compose music for and I don’t sing so not sure what I’ll do with the growing catalog of lyrics.
- My last song I wrote is [Drops](https://chr1stopher.com) published in 2022. I haven’t been producing much music.

#### Music Fan
- New [Pearl Jam](https://pearljam.com) album [Dark Matter](https://pearljam.com/news/dark-matter-out-now) is great.
- The album [Better Will Come](https://lnk.dmsmusic.co/flamingosis_betterwillcome) by [Flamingosis](http://www.flamingosis.com) is a fun listen.
- Love [Kamasi Washington](https://www.kamasiwashington.com)’s new Album “Fearless Movement”. He is one of the best modern jazz musicians.

- [My profile on Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/profile/clsherrod) where I listen to music.

### Slow Health
I’m currently learning [Spring Forest Qi Gong](https://www.springforestqigong.com). As I’ve gotten older I really appreciate the slowness and gentle movements.

### Language Learning
I’m also learning Spanish by practicing it.

### Photography
I love photography. I even got a minor in it in college. I sold a single photo to a newspaper once and been shown in an art gallery once. I never was a professional beyond. I has been a great skill to have learned as a kid as my daily snapshots I share with family and friends are very good.

### Sci-fi
I love a good thought provoking scifi movie or series. Not the horror ones, but the classic 50s thought experiments style.  A good Star Trek over anything Star Wars.

- Enjoyed Season 3 of [Resident Alien](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8690918/episodes/?season=3)
- I found the moral questions and sci-fi comedy of [Uploads Season 3](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7826376/episodes/?season=3) to be fun.
- I really liked [3 Body Problem](https://www.netflix.com/search?q=3%20body%20problem&jbv=81024821) on Netflix. I watched the Chinese 30 episode show last year which was excellent. The English remake makes it more accessible with a faster pace and even better effects.

### Enjoying My Cats
It’s been 11 months since three stray cats crawled over our wall into our compound. One was adopted out and the mother and daughter became part of the family. We were told they were unadopted because they were both a bit wild but now they are great at couch cuddling and playing. They are both welcomed members of the family.
