### Currently Reading
I‚Äôm reading [You Can‚Äôt Screw This Up: Why Eating Takeout, Enjoying Dessert, and Taking the Stress out of Dieting Leads to Weight Loss That Lasts by Adam Bornstein](https://amzn.to/3uTa7PT). I don‚Äôt read diet books but this one is actually really practical. Enjoying it so far.

### Last Read Books
- I read [Generative AI for Busy Business Leaders: How to Use AI With Your Team (A short book that covers simple frameworks and strategies for using gen AI at work)](https://amzn.to/436CyX3) which gave some ideas on how to implement AI into my business.
- And before that I read [Email reputation explained well: How to keep your domains‚Äô reputation clean while growing your business, from someone who had to learn the hard way by Nicol√≤ Rebughini](https://amzn.to/3V9gzwA) which helped me clean up my newsletter lists and increase my deliverability.

My past books I‚Äôve read listed on [my GoodReads profile](https://www.goodreads.com/christophersherrod).

## Weekly Shows/Podcasts
- I‚Äôm enjoying a new podcast [Perplexity Discover Daily](https://www.perplexity.ai/podcast) because it keeps me up to date on the lastly tech news in under 8 minutes.

## Watched Recently
- I‚Äôm currently watching [3 Body Problem](https://www.netflix.com/search?q=3%20body%20problem&jbv=81024821) on Netflix. Episode 1 in and liking it very much. I watched the Chinese 30 episode show last year which was excellent. Hoping the English remake makes it more accessible and even better effects.
- I love watching foreign movies. A different perspective. Recently I enjoyed [Restore Point](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9362492/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) a good sci-fi movie from the Czech Republic.
- I enjoyed the show [Echo](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13966962/?ref_=rt_li_tt) and especially the ending. Being part Native American and from Oklahoma it was nice to see a tribe being represented in media. This and [Reservation Dogs](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13623580/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_8_nm_0_q_reservation%2520dogs) have made a big contribution in representation. I hope more will continue to come out.

## Music
I‚Äôm a huge music fan. Love a lot of different styles of music. I have even created some music.
### Musician
- My last song I wrote is [Drops](https://chr1stopher.com).
- I‚Äôve been writing lyrics, which is new to me. It‚Äôs in a style that I don‚Äôt know how to compose music for and I don‚Äôt sing so not sure what I‚Äôll do with the growing catalog of lyrics.

### Music Fan
- The latest song I really like is [Feel Yourself (YouTube video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZhdLNs7Gvk) by [Flamingosis](http://www.flamingosis.com). Very catchy tune from a new artist to me.
- I‚Äôm looking forward to [Kamasi Washington](https://www.kamasiwashington.com)‚Äôs new Album ‚ÄúFearless Movement‚Äù. He is one of the best modern jazz musicians. He reminds me of John Coltrane, who is my favorite jazz musician of all time.
- I‚Äôve really been enjoying [1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die](https://1001albumsgenerator.com). You can [see my rated albums](https://1001albumsgenerator.com/shares/6093ff2a336e5a7f8b50c476) so far. I‚Äôve got 30 more days before I finish with the 1001 albums and it‚Äôs been fun to listen to lots of music I normally wouldn‚Äôt.

## Enjoying My Cats
It‚Äôs been 10 months since three stray cats crawled over our wall into our compound. One was adopted out and the mother and daughter became part of the family. We were told they were unadopted because they were both a bit wild but now they are great at couch cuddling and playing. They are both welcomed members of the family.
