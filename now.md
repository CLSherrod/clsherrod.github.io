Updated March 8th, 2024.

## Finished A New Article
I published a new article [My Advice For Business Authors: Lessons from a Business Author](https://christophersherrod.com/book-advice/) based on a few conversations with many people over the years about publishing a book.

## Updated An Article
I updated my team workflow article for 2024 [Creators Recommend Apps & Workflow](https://christophersherrod.com/workflow/) with more usage of AI in Descript for title and summaries for shows and ChatGPT for creating email subject lines and editing.

## Enjoying My Cats
Itâ€™s been 10 months since three stray cats crawled over our wall into our compound. One was adopted out and the mother and daughter became part of the family. We were told they were unadopted because they were both a bit wild but now they are great at couch cuddling and playing. They are both welcomed members of the family.
