excerpt: Finally saw Genesis live
---
We happened to be in London and getting all settled into our hotel when I found out that one of my favorite bands was playing in a couple of days nearby. So Nan gets tickets and we have the most wonderful time. I thought I would never see Genesis live in concert ever, so glad I got to see their last concert tour.
