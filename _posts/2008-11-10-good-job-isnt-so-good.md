Having a good job is not what it used to be.  In fact, it's pretty risky.  After working your ass off for many years companies just let you go.  It's happened to many of my family members.

Many people used to love to work for the government or the post office.  Now that dream isn't worth so much.    When people think of their dream job it isn't working for the government.  The dream job is about gaining insight and sharing it with the world.  A job where you have control over your own destiny.

If the recession has changed your life look at it as not a negative but a positive.  A positive move to what you really want.
