One of my mastermind members suggested on today's mastermind call to read [Cosmopolitan magazine](http://www.cosmopolitan.com/) to learn about headline writing and my initial reaction was to laugh, but they were right. Cosmopolitan has the best headlines.

"10 Dating Truths You Can't Ignore"

"Fashion That Will Make Him Want To Touch You"

"9 Beauty Tricks You Need To Know"

These are excellent headlines that get you to want to learn more.

And the headline is the most important part of the article.

So I'm going to make visiting Cosmopolitan magazine a regular to do item. I never thought I would ever read Cosmo.
