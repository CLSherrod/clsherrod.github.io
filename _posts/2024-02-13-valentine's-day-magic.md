Happy Valentine's Day everyone. I wrote this poem for my love of life Nan and thought it would super romantic and inspiring for the rest of you.

## Valentine's Day Magic

On this day of love, my dearest heart,
I send these words, a precious part,
Of all the love that fills my soul,
For you, my darling, make me whole.

With every beat, my love does grow,
More than you may ever know.
Each passing day, you light my way,
In your arms, forever I'll stay.

You've saved my life in every way,
Brought sunlight to my darkest day.
Our life, a dream, so magical and true,
All because, my love, of you.

I can't express how much you mean,
In every scene, you reign supreme.
You're everything I'll ever need,
My love for you, an eternal creed.

So on this Valentine's, I must convey,
My love for you in every way.
You're my joy, my guiding light,
Happy Valentine's, my love, so bright
