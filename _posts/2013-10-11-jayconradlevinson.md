The father of guerrilla marketing Jay Conrad Levinson passed from this realm yesterday.

He wrote the book "Guerilla Marketing".

That was the first book I read on marketing.

After a horrible marketing class in college about corporate branding and stuff that really doesn't work for any business except for the top 1% of business I really thought "Guerilla Marketing" was the absolute best.

Actual real marketing advice that I could actually do.

No focus on branding, and multi-million dollar ads campaigns, but stuff a small business could do.

It changed my direction in life.

I started a software business while working at American Express. And I applied "Guerilla Marketing". Been doing it ever since.

Last year I had the priviledge of meeting Jay and his lovely wife Jeannie at a marketing seminar.

He was amazing. And a really nice guy with a great family.

I will miss you Jay.

RIP JCL
