If you don’t have critics, then you aren’t trying hard enough. You might think I’m kidding, but I’m not. If you're not pushing the envelope, not sharing enough of yourself, and not putting yourself out there, you're not truly striving.

I often get criticized and laughed at when I say you can be successful without being a workaholic. Many people believe that's a big lie, especially since their mentors are major workaholics. So, they think I’m nuts.

Here are some helpful suggestions for dealing with critics. Hopefully, you'll have critics soon if you don't already because it's a sign of success.

What I’ve learned is that if any of these critics get nasty, don’t sink to their level. Remember that as a publisher, you’re also in the business of customer service. I typically handle criticism in one of three ways:

a) Respond calmly and acknowledge their point (some people just want to be heard).

b) Disregard or delete their message (if their comments are too inappropriate or hurtful for a calm response).

c) Remove them from my list.

Even better, have someone else screen your email, like I do now. My assistants protect me wonderfully and only pass on what I need to see. This does wonders for my mood and keeps me in a positive place and good energy.

Through these petty annoyances, remember the big picture of why you started your venture. It was likely to gain credibility and expert status while increasing your marketing reach and revenues. Your professional reputation is always on the line.

You may want to lash back, but in the long run, it always pays to take the high road.
