excerpt: My review of Meet and Grow Rich
---
I met Bill Hibbler last night who along with Joe Vitale wrote  [Meet and Grow Rich](http://www.meetandgrowrich.com) a book about the inner workings of mastermind groups.  I discussed with him my experiences with mastermind group.  I had just finished reading his book the night before so it was fresh on my mind.

He believes the best way to start a mastermind group is to find one person at a time.  My experience shows that this is a good idea.  Form a two person mastermind group and then look for a third that both of you agree on and build it up to six or eight people.  The book is very good and if you are serious about masterminding you should read it.
