[The Tipping Point](https://amzn.to/3S83vWa) was recommended to me for two weeks by many different people. It is unusal to have a book recommended so many times by so many different people so I purchased it right away. I read it in two days and learned a great deal about how small ideas explode by word of mouth and how you can help in the process.

- Law of the few
- Stickyness factor
- Power of contact

<blockquote>"The best way to understand the dramatic transformation of unknown books into bestsellers, or the rise of teenage smoking, or the phenomena of word of mouth or any number of the other mysterious changes that mark everyday life,” writes Malcolm Gladwell, “is to think of them as epidemics. Ideas and products and messages and behaviors spread just like viruses do.” Although anyone familiar with the theory of memetics will recognize this concept, Gladwell’s The Tipping Point has quite a few interesting twists on the subject.</blockquote>
