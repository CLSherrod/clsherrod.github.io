I always loved Roger Ebert"s movie reviews, even if I didn"t agree with him.

I always trusted his opinion. He was a real person giving his real opinion. He would give a thumbs up to movies that weren"t necessarily Oscar winnable, but just a fun movie, sometimes even silly. He was real.

I remember watching his TED Talk on remaking his voice last year and thinking how incredibly brave he is. You can watch his talk - Remaking my voice - above.

[Roger Ebert obit on New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/05/movies/roger-ebert-film-critic-dies.html?_r=0) gives a great history of Roger Ebert.

As the great Roger Ebert wrote: “Your intellect may be confused, but your emotions will never lie to you.” So true.
