## Living on My Own Terms

I don’t care about _slow living_ or _fast living_.  
I care about how I **feel**—that I’m fulfilled in my life.

People like to argue about pace, as if there’s one right speed for living. But life isn’t a race or a meditation retreat. Sometimes I’ve lived fast, pushing hard to get something off the ground, chasing an idea with full momentum. Other times, I’ve slowed to a crawl, moving gently through days that felt fragile or sacred.

Both were right at the time.

After my seizures, I had no choice but to slow down. My body demanded it. My mind, too. It forced me into a quieter rhythm. But in that stillness, I found something deeper—**fulfillment.**
## Fulfillment Over Speed

Fulfillment isn’t about speed.  
It’s about **alignment**.

When I focus on what feels meaningful, I move at the right pace naturally. Some projects come alive in a burst of energy; others take months to simmer.

I don’t compare myself to anyone anymore.  
Not to people who “hustle” all day.  
Not to those who “slow live” perfectly on Instagram.

I focus on _my_ life—doing what I want, working on projects that give me life, and letting the rest fall away.
## The Fulfillment Test

My test is simple:  
Did I feel good about that email?  
That essay?  
That chapter?  
That book?

If I didn’t, I fixed it—or skipped it.

I don’t force things anymore. And if something old no longer matches who I am now, I unpublish it. I let it go.

That’s freedom to me—**living in truth with myself.**

## The Real Art of Living

Maybe that’s what living a fulfilling life is all about.  
Not following a philosophy of fast or slow, but _listening_ to what feels right in this moment.

Life shifts. We change. Our pace changes with us.

What stays constant is this:  
Living in a way that feels like _me._
