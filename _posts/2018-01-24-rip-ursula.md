One of my favorite SciFi writers died Monday. She wrote stories that showed us how different things could be for us. “Light Hand To Darkness” was a major influence for me and highly recommended.

"Hard times are coming," she warned, "when we'll be wanting the voices of writers who can see alternatives to how we live now, can see through our fear-stricken society and its obsessive technologies to other ways of being, and even imagine real grounds for hope. We'll need writers who can remember freedom — poets, visionaries, realists of a larger reality."

RIP Ursula.
