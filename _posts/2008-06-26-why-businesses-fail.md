Government types say that businesses fail because they don't have enough money. I don't believe this at all. Businesses fail because business forget to sell. Professionals think they don't have to sell.

Everyone has to sell. When you ask someone out on a date, you are selling your qualities that make the other person want to go out with you. When a doctor is explaining a producedure he is selling his skills and how they will help you. Everyone sells.

Business that forget that are doomed. "Build it and they will come". No. No. Sell it. Sell it.
