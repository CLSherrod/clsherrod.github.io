I recently co-hosted a business mastermind here right on the water in San Diego this last weekend. We took all of our experience and made an event that we would want to go to ourselves. I was blessed to experience our attendees and have a fantastic time growing our businesses and our minds and souls.

Several students came up to me about how I am very authentic. I'm not being fake. And that is a big part of who I am. I really dislike fake people ( I have a personally issue with using the word hate ). I especially dislike them if they are a coach, so I strive to be real and loving. I have to be strong in order to help you get your best results, and real with you but not be a Drill Sergeant about it. 

Thank you to everyone that came out.
