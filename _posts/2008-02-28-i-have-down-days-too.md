I had a "bad" day yesterday.

I have a wonderful life and I had a down day.  Totally upstream from 1pm on.

Now my morning was fantastic.  Time with my lady Nan in bed, yes indeed, very fantastic.

But, then I got to work at 1pm.  I felt like I wasted half the day.  I felt like I  wasn't going fast enough with my current project.

Nan, went to the beach and I tried to work, but I couldn't think straight.  I felt overwhelmed.   So, I went to read a fiction fun book and then meditate.  It didn't work.  I was still pissed off and I didn't know what to do.  Going to the beach which I can see from our place was a totally upstream thought.  I felt that if I went to the beach I would just being a lazy person.

It wasn't until my mastermind call last night that I finally snapped out of it.  My mastermind group showed me that my life is fantastic.  Most people would be jealousy quite honestly.  And they showed me that the lifestyle that I want is not one of someone working all the time.  I look up to many successful people and some of them are really not for me.  Some work constantly.  One hundred hours a week, non stop.  I can't do that.  I need time to rest and think.  I need time to enjoy the pleasures of the world.

So I work when I'm inspired to do so.  Sometimes that is many hours in a week, more than most people work and sometimes it's not much like yesterday.  I worked for about one hour before going to the hot tub.  My mastermind group helped me change my to do list to something more reasonable to my lifestyle.

If you're not in a mastermind group then form one right now.

I'm off to the beach.
