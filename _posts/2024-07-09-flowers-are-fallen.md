excerpt: Poem about flowers are flowers because they have fallen.
---
I watched Shogun (2024) TV show and one of characters explains that flowers are flowers because they have fallen. And that line really moved me.

## Flowers Are Fallen
Flowers are flowers because they have fallen,
Petals descending like whispers unspoken,
Each fragile bloom, a story to tell,
In their gentle descent, a grace to beheld.

Once standing tall, in vibrant array,
They dance with the wind, then gently give way,
To the earth they return, in a tender embrace,
Finding their beauty in this final grace.

For in falling, they teach us the art of release,
How to let go with elegance and peace,
Their journey complete, they rest on the ground,
Silent reminders of cycles profound.

Flowers are flowers because they have fallen,
In their stillness, a quiet calling,
To cherish each moment, both rise and decline,
In the falling of petals, a truth so divine.

They remind us that beauty lies not just in the bloom,
But in every stage, from birth to tomb,
In the softness of surrender, they find their power,
Teaching us all, in their final hour.
