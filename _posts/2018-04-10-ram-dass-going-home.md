[Ram Dass: Going Home](https://www.netflix.com/watch/80209895)

< >"We are soul. As souls, we are not under time or space. We are infinite."

That is how the new [Ram Dass: Going Home documentary](http://ramdassgoinghome.com/) starts. Appropriately.

Ram Dass is very influential for me. His first book [*Be Here Now*](https://amzn.to/2qmnZfX) influenced me before I read it. Everyone references back to Ram Dass. And I loved his book [*Be Love Now*](https://amzn.to/2v6SFaW) even more. Which helped me see love everywhere. I could see everything.

"Start with your love, your passion and go from there. Then, love everything, everything"

Life is a dream. How do you want to dream it?
