excerpt: My review on the new book How To Live
---
[How To Live](https://sive.rs/h) is an instant classic that will be referenced a hundred years from now. Did you ever want a book that spelled out how to live various parts of your life, from living an independent life, thinking long-term and how to make memories. Even, how to become rich.

Siver's book breaks down every part of your life from your career, to how to interact with people and master one thing in your life.

I found the writing to be straight to the point. I highlighted major sections as it was so densely packed good. There wasn't a part that I felt wasn't needed. And that is what I look for in a classic self-development book, great advice down to the point and direct.

I highly enjoyed this book. You can tell Siver's took quite a bit of time finely honing his writing. It's very well written and easy to digest.

I gave this book a 5-star out of 5-star rating because it will be a book that I incorporate into my daily life, that I'll reference my notes and highlights for the rest of my life. I don't give this high praise on any book usually but the classic self-development books that have highly influenced my life.
