My love showed me a graphic that said Forests = For Rest and I really loved that. So I played with that concept in this poem.

## A Forest Is for Rest

A forest is for rest,
Where nature finds its peace,
Greenery gently breathing,
A sanctuary's sweet release.

A forest is greenery resting,
In quiet, tranquil grace,
A symphony of stillness,
In this soothing, verdant place.

A forest is rest,
Each leaf a whisper soft,
Branches weave a cradle,
Where the soul is gently aloft.

Slowly breathing and resting,
The forest holds its breath,
A rhythm pure and timeless,
In the hush of life's caress.

A forest is for rest,
A haven calm and free,
The place to relax and rest,
In nature's serenity.
