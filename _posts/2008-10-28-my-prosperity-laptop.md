Since most of my work is done on my laptop I have tricked it out as they would say.  But I also decorate it.  I put on what I want.

I bought two cards decks at a couple of bookstores and then picked out the ones that most fit what I wanted.

- Focus on opportunities
- Solve problems for people
- Associate with successful people
- Get support or create a team
- I have an attitude of gratitude
- I choose thoughts that support my prosperous future
- I am earning an excellent income doing what I love
- I trust that my inner guidance will lead me to my dreams
