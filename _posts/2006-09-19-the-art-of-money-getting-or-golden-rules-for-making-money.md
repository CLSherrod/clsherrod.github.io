[The Art of Money Getting or Golden Rules for Making Money](https://amzn.to/3VUgjjK)

I became so excited when I discovered this long lost business book. I have found these “classic” business books to be the basis for modern business books. People back in the early 1900’s knew about business just as much as they do now. Only technology has changed. People haven’t changed much at all.

After reading this little gem it reminded me of “Think and Grow Rich” and “Richest Man in Babylon”. This is one of those classic no nonsense business books. I found P.T. Barnum’s insight to be the same as all the successful business people I know.   Please read this classic business book and then get copies for others. I found it very interesting what people in the early 1900’s thought about business and it comes off very simple. And simple is good.
