Marci Shimoff from the movie "The Secret" just released a new book.

<blockquote>The expression "pursuit of happiness" was coined by Dr. Samuel Johnson in his 1759 novel Rasselas. For such an old phrase, it's about time that someone wrote a book to tell us just how to do that. Marci Shimoff, best known for her Chicken Soup for the Soul series books and her recent appearance in the movie The Secret, seems highly qualified and up to the task. Shimoff along with co-author Carol Kline has just released her new book [Happy for No Reason: 7 Steps to Being Happy from the Inside Out](https://amzn.to/3xKGNwl). The book is full of practical exercises, real life stories and new insights into the science of happiness. Shimoff spent years doing research, in depth interviews and developing and perfecting strategies to create happiness. According to Shimoff, we all have a happiness set pointâ€ that is approximately 50% genetic and 50% learned. She believes it is possible to reprogram our happiness set point to higher levels of peace and well being.</blockquote>
