I recently celebrated 19 years together with the love of my life Nan Akasha. Having a love so deep I think is quite rare in the world. I wrote a #poem to celebrate. @highlight

## Love's Journey: Nineteen Years and Counting

Nineteen years have swiftly flown,
Yet our love has only grown.
Through every laugh, through every tear,
We've stood together, year by year.

I recall our first date, so sweet,
After months of talk, at last we'd meet.
From business discussions to love's embrace,
Our journey began, at a gentle pace.

I remember the moment, crystal clear,
When "I love you" first graced our ears.
Words so simple, yet filled with might,
Setting our hearts aglow that night.

And as the years have come and gone,
Our love has remained, ever strong.
Day by day, it only grows,
Like a river that endlessly flows.

Nineteen years, a testament true,
To the bond that exists between me and you.
Thank you, Nan, for all you do,
For making my dreams come true.

Here's to nineteen years, and many more to come,
Together, forever, under love's gentle sun.
With each passing day, my love for you sways,
In your arms, forever, I'll stay amazed.
