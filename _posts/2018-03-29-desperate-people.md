## The Deal Gone Wrong
Not every business deal goes as planned. Recently, I had a deal fall through in a rather dramatic and unsettling manner. The individual I was working with went to extreme lengths to justify keeping some money, even fabricating evidence and threatening a family member.

## Extreme Measures Taken
Their actions included:
- Creating false photos to support their argument.
- When the fabricated evidence failed, resorting to personal threats.

## Reflecting on the Experience
This experience led me to reflect deeply on what transpired. I asked myself:
- Did I miss any warning signs?
- Have I encountered similar situations in past deals?

## Recognizing the Pattern
A pattern emerged from my reflections. Every deal that failed shared a common thread: desperation. The clients, partners, or contractors were all in dire need of money or status.

## Desperation: The Red Flag
Desperate individuals often construct elaborate narratives to convince themselves that they are victims. They cannot afford to see themselves as wrong, and no amount of contractual documentation, photos, emails, or facts can change their minds. They hit the "nuclear button," opting to protect their interests at any cost, even if it means damaging your reputation.

## Key Takeaways
Here’s what I’ve learned:
- **Desperation is a red flag.** When people are desperate, they will do whatever it takes to secure their financial needs, often creating false stories to rationalize their actions.
- **You can’t win against desperation.** Trying to convince a desperate person of their mistake is usually futile. They are often incapable of admitting fault and will go to great lengths to avoid doing so.
- **State your position and move on.** In such situations, the best course of action is to clearly state your position and then disengage.

## Moving Forward
Dealing with desperate individuals can be a significant challenge. Recognizing the signs early on and knowing when to walk away can save you a lot of time, energy, and potential damage to your reputation. Remember, not every battle is worth fighting, especially when the other party is driven by desperation.
