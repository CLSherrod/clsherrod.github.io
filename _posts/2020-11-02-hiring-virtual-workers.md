## New Book Now Out

I wrote this book to share my hiring process that Iâ€™ve developed since 2000 when I hired my first assistant. I will walk you through my step-by-step process to finding a virtual worker that fits you. I believe your first helper is a virtual assistant followed by an accountant soon afterward. These two hires will impact your business directly and quickly and will pay for themselves very quickly.
