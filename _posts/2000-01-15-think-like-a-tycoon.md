>His story of his success is inspiring.

>I started from scratch, without money, special skills or contacts and founded eight totally unrelated part-time businesses. I watched as each of them earned over a million in three years or less. It's simple once you know how. I discovered a secret formula that every single super-rich person seems to have used to gain wealth. I began applying it and in six months I was a millionaire. I have never looked back.

>While I made my fortune I had fun too. I managed to go to an average of five parties a week. Plus two or three concerts, plays, or movies. As for my love-life... I had more companionship in a year than most people have in a lifetime! Now you can do the same.
