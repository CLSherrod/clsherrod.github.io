excerpt: My review of a Peaceful Warrior movie
---
I had a wonderful weekend.

I was in the Now.  In the present.  Enjoying a really wonderful weekend.

A great mastermind meeting, then a wonderful time at resort and then a movie party for "Peaceful Warrior".

A group consisting of my girlfriend and some friends of ours got together to see the movie "Peaceful Warrior" followed by a party.

I really enjoyed the movie in how it presented being in the now.  One powerful scene for me is when the main character is showering and everything is in slow motion.  He is in the now.  Totally present.  We each shared our favorite scene and had a great time being with like-minded people.

An excellent way to meet like-minded is for you to do the same and hold a movie party and discuss it afterwards.
