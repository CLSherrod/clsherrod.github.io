I had such a good morning yesterday.  I had two clients recommend me to all their family, friends and business associates.  Another client is going to record me a video testimonial.  I have new clients every week and I had the best weekend with my girlfriend Nan.

So I went to a local sushi restaurant for lunch yesterday to celebrate.  After a very nice sushi selection I received my bill.  See the picture on the right.  They automatically print what the tip would at 15%, 18% and 20%.  This is such a nice little touch.  A great  little innovation.

A few little fine touches is what makes a great business.  It is what makes your different.  Innovation is key, especially during a recession.
