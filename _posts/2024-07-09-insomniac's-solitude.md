excerpt: Why I like the quietness of being an insomiac.
---
I've been have quite a bit of insomnia lately. Last night I wrote a poetry line. I can't write in the middle of the night. I'm awake but not enough to understand spoken words or write. I usual listen to sleep music and read.

But, last night I liked being awake in the middle of the night. The quietness, being the only person awake.

I wrote "What I like about insomnia is that it's just me in the world. Everyone around me is asleep, it's dark outside and everything is at peace. I still would rather be sleeping though."

This morning I turned that a proper poem.

## Insomniac's Solitude
What I like about insomnia,
Is the quiet, solitary world,
Where shadows whisper secrets,
And night's blanket is unfurled.

Everyone around me is asleep,
Dreams playing softly in their minds,
While I wander through the silence,
In the peace that darkness finds.

The stars outside are twinkling,
A distant, gentle glow,
The universe in slumber,
While the night winds softly blow.

But despite this calm and stillness,
This serene, hushed, nocturnal scene,
I'd rather be embraced by sleep,
Where dreams paint vivid, unseen.

Yet here I sit, in sleepless hours,
Finding solace in the night,
A world that's mine alone to hold,
Until the dawn brings morning light.
