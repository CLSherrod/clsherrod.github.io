## 2022 AI Became Useful To Everyone

In the constantly changing technology world, the year 2022 stands out as a watershed moment. It marked the point when artificial intelligence (AI) transitioned from a futuristic concept into an accessible, practical tool readily available to the masses. While it’s clear that AI has immense potential, there is also a pervasive fear, especially among creators. Some believe that AI heralds an era where human creativity will be supplanted by bots that can churn out content at unprecedented speeds. But are we really at the precipice of such a future? Not quite. AI, as it stands today, is more of an ally than a rival for creators. In this article, we’ll explore how AI can amplify human creativity rather than diminish it.

## A Personal Experience with AI

For context, it’s worth mentioning that I’ve integrated AI into my daily routine. It’s transformed my workflow, offering insights, shortcuts, and enhancements that I hadn’t even realized I needed. However, it’s essential to note that while AI provides the tools, the direction and intent still come from a human touch.

I primarily use ChatGPT for research and an final editor, much like I used to rely on search engines before they became overrun with spam and a real person editor.

### No AI-Generated Text in My Voice

I have never used AI to generate text in my "voice." No emails, no sentences in my articles or books, not even comments. Nothing pretends to be me.

### The Joy of Writing Myself

I relish the challenge of writing myself. It’s organized thinking. It’s the process I enjoy, not just the end result.

### AI as an Editing Tool

I do, however, use AI to edit my words. It helps with grammar and word choices and provides valuable feedback on how to write more clearly.

### AI in Programming

I also use AI to generate programming functions. It's much faster than hiring a programmer and can handle programming languages I'm not familiar with.

### AI as a Research Assistant

While writing, I often ask it questions I might pose to a friend or editor sitting next to me.

## Dispelling the Myths: AI and Creativity

The fear many creators harbor is rooted in the misconception that AI can replace human creativity. Let’s address this head-on: AI can analyze data, recognize patterns, and even generate content based on predefined algorithms. But it lacks the innate human touch, our experiences, emotions, and the unpredictable spark that often leads to true innovation.

AI should be seen as a collaborative tool. It’s akin to a highly advanced calculator for a mathematician. While the calculator can process numbers quickly and accurately, the mathematician determines the problems worth solving.

## The Role of AI in Creative Processes

For creators, particularly those in the writing domain, AI can be a game-changer. Here’s how:

1. **Drafting & Editing**: AI can help in quickly drafting ideas and can also be used for editing. It can spot grammatical errors, suggest better sentence structures, and even optimize content for better online visibility.

2. **Content Research**: AI can trawl the internet, analyzing vast amounts of data to provide insights on trending topics or content gaps that creators can address.

3. **Personalization**: For creators focused on marketing or tailored content, AI can analyze user behavior to provide insights on what content resonates best with specific audiences.

4. **Visual Content**: For graphic designers and video creators, AI can suggest design enhancements, optimize videos for better viewer retention, and even help in animation.

## My Real Usage
### Research
I come up with most all my ideas to write about but sometimes I’ve used AI to do some research and 
When I’m looking for something to write about and want to see different viewpoints I use AI to ask for it. I take what they say as a junior research assistant and often times disagree.

### Writing & Editing
The biggest controversy in using AI is in writing. AI can produce volumes of copy in an instant. By itself it’s okay but a bit flat. I find AI useful if you think of it as an assistant.

I’ll get an idea to write something and write it until I’m out of ideas. Then I ask AI to rewrite and expand. Then I have to edit that. Many things I write is not of a normal opinion so AI wouldn’t say it in the first place. I write about my experience from. Y viewpoint and then ask AI to edit. And then I still re-edit that. AI is an assistant. A junior copy editor. A very good junior editor, better than I would be.

### Video & Audio Editing
I started using a video editor AI [Descript](https://descript.com) when it was in Beta years ago and was very impressed. It saved my team hours working on content. We went from manually editing videos and audios to having Descript just do its magic. Descript gets rid on my mumps and has filler words, and my long pauses where I’m thinking of what to say next. And it does that automatically with a click on a button. And it produces a transcript within seconds where I can select a sentence and delete.  It’s utterly amazing.

Plus, it’s fixes audio quality and gets rid of background noise automatically. I don’t even have to push a button for that, it’s does it as soon as I hit stop on the recording.

I can record an audio and have it ready to ship in a couple of minutes. I’ve learned to pause when I’m unsure what to say next and the AI will just remove that section. 

We use it exclusively now.

## Authenticity in My Writing

But the real purpose of this page is to let you know that nothing claiming to be written by me is written by artificial intelligence.

## Embracing the Future: AI and You
In conclusion, while AI is a powerful tool, it is just that—a tool. It can’t replicate the unique perspective or emotional depth a human creator brings to the table. Instead of viewing AI as a threat, consider it a sidekick. Embrace its capabilities, understand its limitations, and integrate it where it makes sense. 

In the realm of creation, the human spirit will always be irreplaceable. AI, in its most ideal form, will ensure that this spirit is augmented, refined, and showcased to its fullest potential.
