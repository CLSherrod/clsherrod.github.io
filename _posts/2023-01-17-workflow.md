# My Content Workflow (Tools + Why We Use Them)

This is my team’s workflow for writing, publishing, and running a small digital business without turning it into a full-time tech support job. I update this page whenever the stack changes.

**Last updated:** 2026-01-06

## The philosophy (so the tools don’t run your life)

Most “productivity stacks” are just anxiety with a login screen.

Mine is built around a few rules:
- **Own the source files.** Text should live on my computer, not trapped in a platform.
- **Keep capture friction low.** If it’s annoying, it won’t get used.
- **Automate the boring glue.** Highlights, transcripts, exports, formatting.
- **Prefer tools that survive trends.** Simple formats. Easy backups. Minimal vendor drama.

## Content Workflow Stack
### Notes + thinking (the home base)
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) -This is where everything lives: drafts, ideas, research notes, checklists, and “stuff I don’t want to forget.” It’s fast, local-first, and the plugin ecosystem is genuinely useful. Most important: my notes are just files. Future-proof beats fashionable.
- Read my essay [How Smart Notes Transformed My Productivity and Well-being](https://christophersherrod.com/smart-notes/) about I use smart notes for everything.
### Reading + highlights (research without the mess)
- [Readwise](http://readwise.io) - I read a lot. Readwise keeps highlights organized and pushes them into Obsidian automatically, which turns “I highlighted that somewhere…” into “I can actually use this while writing.”
### Capture (photo + video without fuss)
- [iPhone - Apple](https://www.apple.com/iphone/) and Mac laptop camera - We keep it simple. These cover 99% of what we need for quick video clips, photos, and casual content.
### Live calls + classes
- [Zoom](https://zoom.us) Classes and private sessions. Boring, reliable, ubiquitous. That’s a compliment.
### Video editing + transcription (fast turns into published)
- [Descript](https://descript.com) This replaced heavier editing workflows for us. It’s quick for cleanup, transcription, and turning audio into usable content. The speed matters: if editing takes forever, publishing slows down and then “content” becomes a guilt hobby.
### Visuals (covers, thumbnails, simple graphics)
- [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com) - I use it for cover images and site graphics, and it also helped restart my creative momentum after my 2019 seizure. We maintain a few consistent styles (especially across newsletters), and it’s eliminated the need for paid stock imagery.
- [Canva](https://www.canva.com) - When a graphic needs text overlays or quick layout, Canva is the fastest path. If something needs more precise design work, a team member may use Photoshop—same goal, different tool.
- [Eagle](https://eagle.cool/) - If you produce lots of images, you need a real system. Eagle lets me organize, tag, and export images in the exact sizes I need (email, website, YouTube thumbnails), including WebP. This one tool saves a surprising amount of time.
### Publishing + commerce
- [WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org) and  [WooCommerce](https://woocommerce.com) - We still use WordPress for sites where multiple people publish and update content. WooCommerce runs a digital shop with a lot of products, and it works.
- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) - This personal site is static, on purpose. Less maintenance. Less plugin drama. Less “security update Tuesday.” Static sites are underrated if you want calm.
- [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com)- We use it as a writing assistant: rewrites, polish, subject lines, SEO titles, summaries, and descriptions. It’s not the author. It’s the sharp editor that never gets tired.
### Video hosting (private, clean delivery)
- [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com) - Private product videos live here. Easy link sharing inside WooCommerce.
### Email delivery (cost-effective and under control)
- [Sendy](https://sendy.co) - Self-hosted, inexpensive, and does what we need. Setup is more technical than “modern newsletter platforms,” but the tradeoff is worth it for cost and control.
### Livestreaming
- [StreamYard](https://streamyard.com) - For livestreaming to multiple destinations without duct-taping a complex setup together. It’s reliable and the studio features are strong.

## Team Workflow
-  [Slack](https://slack.com) Team communication (we work with a team in Manila). It’s been solid for years. No reason to change.
- [Google Workplace](https://workspace.google.com) - Email, calendar, docs, slides. The boring backbone of operations.
## Adapt
If you want to build a workflow like this, steal the _principles_ first. The tools are replaceable. The system is the asset.
