I don't usually use an alarm clock and when I do it's not an alarm. I wake up to the song "What a Wonderful World".

An alarm is too jaring, scares me to death. A gentle song like "What a Wonderful World" gentle wakes me up and it is so uplifting and so pleasing to hear that I stay in bed until the song is over. Then I feel refresh and ready to start my day. Or if I decide to sleep in some more I just press the pause button and gentle fail back to sleep.

Reduce your stress by choosing your favorite gentle song to wake up to and enjoy the bliss from waking up to a wonderful world.
