excerpt: Poem about silencing interruptions while being creative.
---
I've been having some distractions lately and haven't been writing as much as I would like which leads me to write about interruptions. So, I got in my hot tub, relaxed and wrote this.

## Silencing Interruptions: A Battle for Creative Space

In the rhythm of thought, where words collide,
A symphony of silence, where ideas reside.
Laptop poised, mind ignited, ready to soar,
But then comes the interruption, knocking at the same device.

Like a thunderclap in the midst of a dream,
Interjections shatter the tranquil stream.
The flow disrupted, the muse takes flight,
As distractions invade, stealing the night.

Fingers itching, to pour out the soul,
But interruptions wield their ruthless toll.
Phone buzzing, doorbell ringing, voices intrude,
A cacophony of chaos, a poet's feud.

In the sanctuary of creation, I seek refuge,
But interruptions persist, a relentless deluge.
Yet still, I rise, reclaiming my space,
For the written word, I'll fiercely embrace.

So let this echo, a battle cry,
Against interruptions, as I reach for the sky.
In the pursuit of art, I'll stand tall and fight,
For my voice shall not be silenced, in the dead of night.
