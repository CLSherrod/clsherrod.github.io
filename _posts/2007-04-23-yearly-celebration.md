I had one of two birthday parties last night.

Yes I'm having another one next Saturday.  I'm abundant.

It's very important to celebrate life.

My wonderfully fantastic girlfriend organized both.  I'm getting emails wanting her to be their social planner.  Sorry (not really) she's busy and fully booked. ;-)

I got to hit the pinata first, then we let all the kids at it.

It was wonderful to have so many people come to celebrate with me.  I have such great friends.  I got enough wine and tequila to last for quite a while.  Thank you to everyone that came.

I'm off to the coast for a vacation.
