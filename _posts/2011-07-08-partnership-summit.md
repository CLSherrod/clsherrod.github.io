excerpt: "Lessons from Partnership Summit"
---
My Partnership Telesummit ended yesterday.

Out of a number of speakers I got some feedback from my audience.

Some were very vocal and emailed me back directly stating that two speakers were out of alignment with what they expected from me.

I agree somewhat.

Two were very pushy. Direct to the max with a buy this or else attitude. You can be a sales person and focus on selling but you can take it too far.

And when you partner with people sometimes it doesn't work out. I like to test compability doing small projects first. I have many people that I've done that with that I wouldn't ever do anything in business with ever again.

I can be polite and even friendly but just not pursue doing anything with them unless something majorly changed.
