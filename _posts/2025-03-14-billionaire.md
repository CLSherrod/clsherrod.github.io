Somewhere along the way, people started treating billionaires like gods. Entrepreneurs, influencers, and tech moguls are worshipped as if they have all the answers. But here’s the truth: **they don’t care about you**.  

They just want to be adored so their empire doesn’t crumble. And the more attention you give them—good or bad—the more power they hold.  

It’s time to stop feeding the beast.  

## 1. Admire the Work, Not the Person
You don’t have to “cancel” successful people just because you don’t like them. If someone builds a great product, you can appreciate the product without turning the creator into a saint.  

It’s possible to say, “This car, phone, or software is great,” without bowing down to the billionaire who made it.  

## 2. Attention Is Their Lifeline—Don’t Feed It
Good press? They win.  
Bad press? They still win.  

People love to “hate-follow” public figures, constantly talking about how terrible they are. But guess what? That still gives them power. **Any news is good news** for them.  

If you don’t like someone, the best thing you can do is **ignore them completely**. Don’t give them your energy—good or bad.  

## 3. Everyone Makes Mistakes—Including You
I’ve made plenty of mistakes. We all have. The difference is, when an average person screws up, the whole world isn’t watching.  

If you dislike someone because of their mistakes, that’s your choice. But holding onto that anger doesn’t do anything except waste your own time. Move forward.  

If someone doesn’t like me because of something I did in the past? **Fine, ignore me.** But I refuse to live my life trying to please people who won’t let go of the past.  

## 4. If Your Life Feels Empty, Stop Looking at Others
Here’s a hard truth: If you’re obsessed with billionaires—whether worshipping them or tearing them down—**you’re wasting your own life**.  

Life is supposed to be fulfilling. If it’s not, don’t blame some rich guy on Twitter. **Change your attitude.** Focus on your own progress instead of obsessing over someone else’s success or failure.  

## 5. Economic Blackouts Can Work in Extreme Cases

While ignoring billionaires and egomaniacs is the best day-to-day approach, there are times when collective action is necessary. Organized economic blackouts can be a powerful tool for real change. When large groups of people refuse to spend money on a company or brand, it can force those in power to listen. Economic pressure works effectively when used strategically and in extreme cases where change is truly needed. It's also best to give your energy to alternatives—support businesses and creators whose values align with your own. Shifting your focus and dollars towards better options can create lasting change.

## Final Thought: Live Your Own Life
Stop giving billionaires and egomaniacs your energy. Don’t waste time defending them, and don’t waste time hating them. Just **live your life**.  

If you want success, build something. If you want happiness, focus on what fulfills you. And if someone doesn’t add value to your life? **Ignore them and move on.**
