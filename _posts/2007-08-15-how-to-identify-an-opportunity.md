excerpt: What to consider when looking for opportunities.

Richard Branson is what I consider the best entrepreneur.  Here is what he considers for looking for an opportunity.

> "We look for opportunities where we can offer something better, fresher, and more valuable, and we seize them. We often move into areas where the customer has traditionally received a poor deal, and where the competition is complacent.And with our growing e-commerce activities, we also look to deliver old' products in new ways. We are pro-active and quick to act, often leaving bigger and more cumbersome organizations in our wake. When we start a new venture, we base it on hard research and analysis.Typically, we review the industry and put ourselves in the customer's shoes to see what could make it better.*
