Only people with the right mindset will win.

What makes you have a mindset that has you expecting breathtaking success every time you attempt something?  Well, a number of things come to mind.

You don't suffer from jealously about the success of others. George Lucas doesn't have to have a bomb so Steven Spielberg can have a hit movie. Madonna's new album doesn't have to tank so that Whitney Houston can have a hit. There is enough prosperity to go around.

So it's important that you celebrate the success of others. Even if you perceive them to be your competition. In most cases, competition enlarges the available market.
