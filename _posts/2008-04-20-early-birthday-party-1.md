I was quietly relaxing on the back porch when my love Nan called me and told me there was a change of plans.  Instead of dropping one the kids friends back at her place they were buying me presents and going to throw me an early birthday party.  Even the kids friend insisted on coming back to our place to celebrate.  It was touching and I couldn't get back to what I was thinking about while waiting for them.

When they got back home I had several presents and some great food.  I got two audio cards.  One that played the theme to Jaws and the other from the Twilight Zone.  I also got a sound button that says "Force Field" and plays a song from Star Wars.  A "Celebrate" word to dangle from my keys.  And cup that says "Don't Worry Be Happy" and of course plays Bobby McFerrin's song.  I play that song all the time.  It's one of my favorites.

My love Nan got me a picture frame that plays "What a Wonderful World" by Louis Armstrong.  I have it on my iPod all the time.  If I need to set an alarm in the morning I wake up to that song.  That present really touched me.  I'm going to put a photo of my wonderful family in it.

Enjoy life.  Celebrate it often.  Have a blast.
