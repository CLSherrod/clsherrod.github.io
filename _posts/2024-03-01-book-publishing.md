My Advice For Business Authors
<!--more--> 

If you’re diving into the world of writing and publishing, especially in the business realm, I’ve got some tips to share with you.

## Strategic Compass In The Book World

### 1. Keep It Realistic

Don’t set your expectations sky-high. Enjoy the process of writing without getting caught up in dreams of instant success.

### 2. Start Early

Begin promoting your book at least three years before it hits the shelves. Build your reputation, connect with your audience, and get people excited while you write your book.

### 3. Invest in Editing

Engage a skilled editor, not merely for typos but to transform your narrative into a compelling read. The editorial process should be valued and prioritized. AI is helpful with this step now. Use AI as a writing companion and editor. You can talk to an AI like a real person and get amazing honest feedback.

### 4. Share Generously

Think of your book as a platform for your ideas, not just a product to sell. The more you give, the more you’ll get back.

### 5. Focus Your Marketing

Don’t try to appeal to everyone. Find your niche and own it.

### 6. Forget Mainstream Media

Instead of chasing big publicity, focus on reaching your target audience directly.

Resist the allure of hiring a publicist for mainstream media. 

### 7. Consider Self-Publishing

Traditional publishing isn’t the only route. Self-publishing can be way faster and more efficient.

### 8. Design Matters

Your book cover is important. It’s the first thing people see, so make sure it grabs their attention. AI is helpful with coming up with a complelling book image.

### 9. Work With Your Publisher

If you’re going the traditional route, make sure you’re involved in decisions about editing, cover design, and promotion.

### 10. The One-Year Reminder

Remember the importance of a one-year lead for pre-release promotion remains paramount.

### 11. Blurbs vs. Blog Mentions

While traditional endorsements may be overrated, mentions in influential blogs can significantly impact your book’s success.

### 12. Time-Tested Strategies: Signings and Book Clubs

Patience is key when engaging in bookstore signings and connecting with book clubs by phone – methods that guarantee results.

### 13. Embrace the PDF Alternative

Consider offering free PDF versions. It simplifies access, garners joy without financial constraints, and can attract millions of downloads. Growing your audience is your main goal and doing it directy is highly recommended. A real book is helpful when meeting people in real life and conferences otherwise why not just make it a giveway on your website and drive traffic to it.

### 14. Connect Outside Traditional Avenues

To reach non-traditional book buyers, position yourself where they are – in various media outlets, virtual spaces, and real-world events.

### 15. Caseload Sales: Organizations Matter

Many bestsellers thrive on bulk sales to organizations. Target entities purchasing on behalf of members or employees.

### 16. Publishing vs. Printing

Distinguish between publishing and printing. Understanding the marketing, sales, distribution, and risk aspects is crucial for success.

### 17. Bookstores: An Honest Appraisal

While bookstores and their staff are often delightful, they aren’t always the most effective business platforms. Recognition frequently occurs before readers enter the store.

### 18. The Invaluable Experience

Writing a book isn’t just a task; it’s a transformative journey. It stimulates intellectual growth, refines thoughts, builds credibility, and serves as a perpetual marketing engine.

## Conclusion: A Literary Odyssey

Embarking on the odyssey of writing is more than crafting words; it’s about strategic navigation in a vast literary sea. These lessons, learned from the seasoned voyage of a long-time entrepreneur-author, illuminate the path to not just writing a book but ensuring its meaningful impact in the world.
