Boyfriend/Girlfriend, Husband/Wife, Domestic Partner are all old terms for what is really a Partner. A partner in life. I have a wonderful partner in life who I adore.

Saying anything but partner seems weird as I look at us as equals without the baggage of the old terms. Nan is the best partner I've ever had by a large margin.
