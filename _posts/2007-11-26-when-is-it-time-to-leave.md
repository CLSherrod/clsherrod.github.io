How do you know when it's time to leave what you are doing and move on?

I've had to make this decision a few times in my past.Â  In the past I've stayed with things longer than I now think I should have. I like speed, but I don't want to move on to fast.

I've learned to do some deeper introspection to get clear on your motivations for leaving.

If you feeling avoidance or fear then realize that and write up proof of why you should leave. If you stay you may find additional opportunities.

If you feel that you're done and leaving is the best thing you can do then, do it - fast. Moving on will provide you with more opportunity. It also helps the people around you as what you are doing isn't fulfilling them either.

It's exciting to find out what is next in life. Be excited about yours.
