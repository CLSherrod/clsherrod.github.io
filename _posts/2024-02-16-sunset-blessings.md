excerpt: Poem about xploring the beauty and wisdom of each fleeting moment.
---
I was looking at my daily sunset photos I take here in my beach home in Mexico and I feel blessed that I have another day to live. As day fades into night, a sacred ritual unfoldsâ€”the sunset. In "Sunset Blessings," we delve into this enchanting spectacle, where the sky becomes a canvas of vibrant hues. Join me in exploring the beauty and wisdom of each fleeting moment, as the sun whispers timeless secrets of life's gentle rhythm.

## Sunset Blessings
Each day's end, a golden display,
On the beach, where the sun finds its way.
A blessing bestowed, a reminder to see,
That another day lived is a gift to me.

The sunset's embrace, a daily grace,
Paints the sky in hues, a celestial chase.
Each evening unfolds, a masterpiece anew,
A symphony of colors, a dream come true.

As I watch the sun dip below the sea,
I'm reminded of life's gentle decree.
Each day may seem familiar, yet unique,
A tapestry of moments, in which we seek.

The sunset whispers secrets untold,
Of time's slow dance, as ages unfold.
With each passing day, the sun moves on,
A gentle reminder that life's marathon.

So I cherish each sunset, each day's end,
Grateful for the blessings, to nature, I send.
For in the rhythm of dusk's gentle glow,
I find solace in knowing, life's ebb and flow.
