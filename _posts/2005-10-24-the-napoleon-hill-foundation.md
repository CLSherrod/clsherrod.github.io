exerpt: Futher resources after Think And Grow Rich
---
I just finished Napoleon Hill’s book *Think And Grow Rich".  At the end of the book they have an offer for a free bookplate with Dr. Hill’s signature.  So I started writing a letter asking for it.  I thought oh there is a foundation I wonder if they have a website.  After a quick search I found [The Napoleon Hill Foundation](http://www.naphill.org/) on the web.  The foundation has several seminars and other resources listed.  Plus a Mastermind Online Success Club.

>Our Mastermind Online Success Club is an international group of enthusiastic members who are like-minded in that all share a common interest in the works and teachings of Dr. Napoleon Hill and motivational practices that work.
