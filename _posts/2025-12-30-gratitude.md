## I Used to Wait for Gratitude to Find Me

For a long time, I treated gratitude like a reaction.

If something went well, I felt thankful.

If life felt smooth, I noticed the good.

On hard days, gratitude disappeared.

After my seizures began, that approach collapsed. Nothing about my life felt predictable. Plans fell apart. Energy vanished. Fear moved in quietly and stayed.  

I kept waiting for reasons to feel grateful, and they stopped arriving.

That was the moment I learned something simple and unsettling. Gratitude is not a response. It is a practice.

## Gratitude Is a Daily Decision

I did not wake up one morning filled with appreciation. I started with resistance. Some days I wrote the same three things again because nothing else came to mind.

Warm coffee.

A body that carried me through the day.

A moment of quiet.

It felt small. It felt thin. I kept going anyway.

Over time, something shifted. My days did not change much, but my attention did. I began noticing what had been present all along.

Gratitude trains attention. Attention shapes experience.  

This is not positive thinking. It is honest seeing.

## Gratitude Does Not Ignore Pain

One mistake I made early on was treating gratitude like denial. As if being thankful meant I had to ignore grief, anger, or fear.

That never worked.

Real gratitude leaves room for truth. Some days I felt grateful and broken at the same time. I learned those states do not cancel each other.  

I could grieve my old life and still feel thankful for a steady breath.

I could feel afraid and still appreciate a friend who checked in.

Gratitude grows strongest when it stands beside pain, not when it replaces it.

## A Practice, Not a Personality Trait

I used to believe grateful people were wired differently. Kinder. Calmer. More spiritual.

That belief kept me stuck.

Gratitude does not belong to a personality type. It belongs to repetition. What you return to daily becomes familiar. What becomes familiar feels natural.

I set a rule for myself. Every morning, before touching my phone, I name three things I appreciate. Nothing impressive. Nothing curated.

Some mornings it is sleep.

Some mornings it is sunlight on the wall.

Some mornings it is the fact that I woke up at all.

Consistency matters more than depth.

## How Gratitude Softened My Nervous System

Living with seizures taught me how alert my body stayed. I was always scanning for danger. Always braced.

Gratitude did something unexpected. It softened that vigilance.

When I focused on what felt stable, even briefly, my body responded. Breath slowed. Shoulders dropped. Thoughts became less sharp.

This was not spiritual theory. It was lived experience.

Gratitude signals safety. Safety allows rest.

Over time, rest made room for clarity.  

## Gratitude Changed How I Measure a Good Day

I used to measure days by output. Work done. Goals met. Progress made.

Gratitude asked a different question.

Was I present.

Did I notice what mattered.

Did I treat my body with respect.

Some days were quiet and unproductive. They still counted.

A grateful life values being over achieving.  

## A Simple Way to Begin

If this feels distant or forced, start smaller than you think you should.

Tonight, before sleep, name one thing that held you. Not something impressive. Something real.

A chair.

A meal.

A moment without noise.

Do it again tomorrow.

Gratitude does not need belief. It needs return.

Over time, it becomes less about listing blessings and more about inhabiting your life.

That is what changed everything for me.

Not because life became easier.

Because I learned how to meet it.
