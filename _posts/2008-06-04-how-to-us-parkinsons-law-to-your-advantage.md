Ever heard of Parkinson's Law?  The simple statement that work expands to fill the time available for its completion.  Joel has an excellent article about Parkinson's Law and some tips on how to use it to your advantage.

>Parkinson's Law -  *work expands to fill the time available for its completion * - means that if you give yourself a week to complete a two hour task, then (psychologically speaking) the task will increase in complexity and become more daunting so as to fill that week. It may not even fill the extra time with more work, but just stress and tension about having to get it done. By assigning the right amount of time to a task, we gain back more time and the task will reduce in complexity to its natural state.

I once read a response to Parkinson's Law insinuating that if it were an accurate observation, one would be able to assign a time limit of one minute to a task and the task would become simple enough to complete within that minute. But Parkinson's Law is exactly that - an observation, not some voodoo magic. It works because people give tasks longer than they really need, sometimes because they want some leg room' or buffer, but usually because they have an inflated idea of how long the task takes to complete. People don't become fully aware of how quickly some tasks can be completed until they test this principle.
