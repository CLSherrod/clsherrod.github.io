Yesterday I blogged about Virgin and why [complaining customers are the best](/complaining-customers/).  Well, today Virgin offers the complaining customer a job.

>A Virgin Atlantic spokesman said that an offer has been extended to the complainant to select new meals to serve on the airline.
"While we investigated his complaint seriously, and following Richard Branson's phone call, we've invited him to our catering house to select the next range of meals and wines we serve on board. Then we can ensure his personal taste is well and truly catered for," said the representative.

This made me laugh.  Richard Branson and Virgin are so smart.  Wouldn't you want a truly discerning person picking out your meals for your airline?  This is just so brilliant.
