I’m different from the normal crowd.

When I heard of Steve Irwin’s death, it gave me a smile.  Not because I’m glad he is dead.  I’m actually quite sad.  It has taken me almost a week to write this article.  I’m happy that someone lived their life full out.  So many people live mediocre lives.

Steve did what he loved.  Can you imagine him doing anything else?

“Would you like fries with that?”

I can’t imagine him every saying that.

And I’m glad he never did.

He lived more in his life than most people every do in several lifetimes.

Entrepreneurs are like Steve.  They go full out.  They fail sometimes but they are doing.  They do what they are passionate about and the money follows.  How many people told him that chasing crocodiles would make him prosperous?  Most likely quite a few people told him he was nuts.  Prosperous people do what they envision in spite of what the negative people say.

Here is to Steve for having a wonderfully prosperous life.  I will miss you and I know you thoroughly enjoyed life and wouldn’t have done it any other way.  Cheers.
