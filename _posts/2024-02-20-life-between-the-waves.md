excerpt: Poem about living life between the waves.
---
I love being simple. Being simple has made me appreciate all the moments in life. Everything is stillness if you appreciate it. I wrote this poem to appreciate the life between the waves.

## Savoring Simplicity: Life Between the Waves
In the quiet spaces between the waves,
Where time slows down, and stillness craves,
There lies a world of simple grace,
Where life unfolds at its own pace.

To be zen is to savor the slow,
To find joy in the gentle flow,
Of moments passing, without haste,
In the beauty of simplicity, life embraced.

In the rustle of leaves, in the song of birds,
In the whispers of wind, in the hush of words,
There's a symphony of serenity, a tranquil sea,
Where the soul finds solace, where the heart is free.

To appreciate the slowness is to understand,
That life's true riches lie in the unplanned,
In the moments of quiet, in the space to breathe,
In the simplicity of being, we find our reprieve.

So let us cherish the moments in between,
Where life's true beauty can be seen,
In the slowness, in the stillness, in the quietude,
Life's deepest truths are quietly imbued
