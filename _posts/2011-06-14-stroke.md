I meet a woman that had a stroke a few weeks ago.

Her business has increased since the stroke because she doesn't have any choice but to succeed.

If life is too cushy for you, you won't really go for it.

Sometime the hardest things in your life are the best things for your life.

Her story was really inspiring to me.

If she can do it. You can do it.

There are no excuses.

Go out an make it happen.
