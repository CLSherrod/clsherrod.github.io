There is no ABC formula for success that everybody can get to work.  Doesn't exist.  If it did then there would only be on success book.  Nobody else would have written a success book if the only one worked for everyone.

There are many many success books.  Health, diet, finance, relationships, etc, etc.  You name it there is a bunch of books, ebooks, videos, courses and seminars.

Keep on your success course.  Try many options and never give up on your vision.  Some books will help you, some will not.  Some people you will like and then fall out of out it and move on to others.  Go with the flow.  Keep on course and feel your way.

You create your own reality and you are in charge of it.  It is up to you.
