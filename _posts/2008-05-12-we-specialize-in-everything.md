Seth asks a great question for your business.  What are you specializing in?  What are you really good at?  What is your passion?  Know that and you know your next step.  Also, Seth has an action figure out.  See picture.  Marketing is powerful.

>When choice is limited, I want a generalist. When selection is difficult, a jack of all trades is just fine.

But whenever possible, please bring me a brilliant specialist.

If you're shaking your head in agreement with this obvious point, then the question is: tell me again why you're a generalist?
