excerpt: Poem about embracing your worth.
---
I penned this poem as a reflection on a choice I've made, one that may seem personal yet holds deeper significance. It's an exploration of why I've chosen not to be friends with certain individuals, a decision that intertwines personal boundaries with broader reflections on life's journey.

## Embracing Self-Worth: A Departure from Toxicity

In the realm of self-worth, I stand tall and true,
My esteem, a fortress, steadfast and anew.
For I refuse to barter, to compromise my soul,
To befriend the shadows that seek to control.

Your presence, a specter of doubt and disdain,
A toxic brew that seeps through the vein.
But my self-esteem, a beacon of light,
Guides me away from the darkness of night.

I refuse to dwell in the depths of despair,
To succumb to the whispers of self-doubt's snare.
For my worth is not defined by your gaze,
But by the strength of my spirit's blaze.

So I bid you farewell, with a heart unswayed,
In the realm of self-esteem, I've found my shade.
No room for toxicity, no space for your view,
My self-esteem soars, and I bid you adieu.
