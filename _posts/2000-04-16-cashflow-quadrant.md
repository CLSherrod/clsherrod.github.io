excerpt: My review of Cashflow Quadrant
---
From [Cashflow Quadrant](https://amzn.to/4cCta1g)

I use this book to teach people about the differences in making money and having a system make money.  Robert is good at making this very simple.

>What is the difference between and employee and a business owner? Why do some investors make money with little risk while most investors just break even? Why do most employees go from job to job while others quit their jobs and go on to build business empires?

>THE CASHFLOW QUADRANT answers these questions and guides readers in finding their own path to financial freedon in a world of ever increasing financial change. It is a book written...

>for people who are ready to move beyond job security and begin to find their own world of financial freedom.

>For people who are ready to make deep professional and financial changes in their lives

>For people who are ready to move from the Industrial Age to the Information Age

>Have you noticed that many of the brightest graduates from our universities want to work for college dropouts...dropouts such as Bill Gates of Microsoft, Richard Branson of Virgin Industries, Michael Dell of Dell Computers, Ted Turner of CNN? Dropouts who are today the mega-rich oof society. Why does this happen? As THE CASHFLOW QUADRANT reveals, it is simply a matter of knowing which quadrant to work from and when.
