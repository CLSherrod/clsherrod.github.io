## Horowitz's Abundance marketing

It works for small businesses and it way more fun.

What is unique about Horowitz's view of business is that he has taken this optimistic concept of the glass being half-full and created a marketing philosophy to go with it.

His philosophy revolves around what he calls the abundance model, in which entrepreneurs can view their opportunities through an abundance filter. This filter is dramatically different from what most business leaders have been taught in the past. Typically, business students were taught to buy into the very aggressive big-box American-style business philosophy.

The big-box business approach is like playing football, or waging a war. It is based on the overall perspective that a business grows only by taking clients, revenues, sales or ideas from its competitors: that it is a dog-eat-dog world, and only the fittest survive.

Horowitz's abundance perspective leads to another premise: there is enough business out there for everybody. If one buys that argument, then clearly the focus on market share is obsolete, because there is simply enough market share to go around. If there is enough market share to go around, one's marketing strategy focuses on how to get a piece of that market share, without having to compete aggressively to get it.

This approach seems reasonable on an intuitive level, and it also sounds like a very comfortable way to expand a business. The notion focuses more on sharing and market sustainability than it does on competition. If the goal of a firm is not to compete for a market, but to share it with others, this change in goals brings about dramatic changes in marketing strategy.

Suddenly, co-operative partnerships become more feasible. Why not share the wealth instead of controlling it? Small businesses in the tourism industry have been doing this for years, creating packages by combining goods and services from various businesses in the community. The end result is that the companies reach their goals, the market is sustained and consumers are better served.

If the goal shifts from competing for market share to sharing the market, suddenly promotion becomes more targeted to specific users and the message becomes more creative. Rather than spending promotional dollars trying to describe how one's product is better than someone else's, the promotion focuses on the virtues of one's product vis-a-vis customer's needs and wants.
