Listen.  Listening is important.  There isn't enough of it going around in the world I believe.  I learn the most when I listen to my friends and clients.  Clients will tell you everything they want just by listening to them.

Here is a good quote from Evan Carmichael on waiting your turn in your mastermind group.

>One of the things I keep learning from the Mastermind groups I'm in is waiting for my turn. I keep bumping into my own ego - I keep wanting everyone to be there for me - for me to tell them what they should do and for everyone concentrating on supporting what I want. Particularly those times when I'm either bubbling up with ideas or doubling over with problems.
