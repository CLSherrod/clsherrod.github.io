I didn't think I was good at public speaking.  I joined Toastmasters and did that for over a year until I got so comfortable with my group that I wasn't learning anymore.  If I know people I can easily speak out, doing that in front of a lot of strangers was another story.

So I started focusing on speaking in front of strangers.

Nan my girlfriend, encouraged me to just say what was on my mind.  "Let them see how wonderful you are" is a common quote from her to me.  So I started to be more expressive.  And it has worked.  I've spoken at several engagements and people are seeing me as very knowledgeable.  I've even gotten comments telling me I was the best speaker at a multiple speaker event.  This thrilled me.  I thank Nan for encouraging me into doing this.

Everyone should have someone in their life supporting and encouraging them.

But it comes down to you and your story in your own head.

I use to believe I wasn't good as a speaker because I got a C in public speaking in college (my only C I have ever received). I kept repeating that story until I got an interrupt from Nan who saw me talk for hours on end in a hot tub when I was relaxed.  She showed me that my story I had in my head was false.  That was then and right now I'm a completely different person  who totally enjoys interacting with people and showing them how to create new business ideas and then helping them implement them.

What false beliefs are holding you back?  What can you interrupt to get you on the path of your true greatness?
