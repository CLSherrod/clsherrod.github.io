You are your first client. If you don't prioritize yourself everyone else suffers.

If you don't market or manage the marketing and just work on clients then you soon won't have any clients. You must stay in business, you must market, if you don't you'll go out of business which your clients won't like. I'm pretty sure you won't like it either. So put yourself first and keep your clients happy by staying in business and growing.
