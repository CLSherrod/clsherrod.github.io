Prosperity is an ongoing state of being.  A journey.  Only by freeing yourself from the struggle with money will you be able to find your real purpose in life.  Enjoy the adventure.

Financial freedom is not guaranteed by simply having lots of money.  What is required is a clear understanding of one's self and the knowledge of how to build firm financial structures.  Your freedom resides in you and not in the money.  The quality of your life is as much of what is inside you as what you surround yourself with.  Remember, to include yourself in your investment portfolio.  Invest in yourself.  Every dollar you spend on your own growth will pay bigger dividends and make all the physical acquisitions more valuable to you.

Many fears throughout life are so natural that we assume we cannot alter them.  We inherited them from family, friends and society in general.
