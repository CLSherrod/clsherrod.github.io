Robins Williams (yes the comic) and his daughter who was named after Zelda the video game appear in an ad for the new Zelda game "The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D".

You know you have a great brand name when people name their kids after them. Heck, someone name their kid Facebook recently. That's cruel. But Zelda. That's cool.

Have a great product and be consistant about it and you too can have a name people want to name their kids after, even if it is a horrible name Facebook.
