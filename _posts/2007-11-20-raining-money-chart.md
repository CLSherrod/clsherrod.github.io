I recently updated my multiple streams of income chart and it really changed my life. I'm seeing more potential, faster, and easier.

So I want to explain how you can create your own "Raining Money Chart".

I use a mind mapping program to do mine.

I put each market segment my companies are in around a central box of "Business". Off of each market segment I write boxes with the name of the product or service that we offer. I also write down ideas that I haven't implemented yet and make them a different color.

Once my chart is complete I put it in my journal and on my office wall.

Looking at it inspires me and give me more ideas of how to expand in a certain market.
