## My Blog Has A New Home<!--more-->
<br>
After using several different domain names I’ve settled down to using my name for my domain name. Any other projects or companies I work on will have their own domain name. This will give me a base to keep in touch with you. I'll import my old blog posts from my previous websites over time.
