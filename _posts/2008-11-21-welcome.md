My Blog Has A New Home and my articles have been moved here from several sites.

After using several different domain names I’ve settled down to using my name for my domain name. Any other projects or companies I work on will have their own domain name. This will give me a base to keep in touch with you. I'll import my old blog posts from my previous websites over time.
