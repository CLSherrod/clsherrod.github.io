I really do hate voice mail. Someone calls you while you're on the phone or bathroom (hint, don't answer the phone while in the bathroom, it's disgusting) and they leave a voice mail. Now I have to call my voice mail and listen to a way too long recording and then they don't leave their phone number.

It's enough to make me not want to check voice mail and just call the number back and ask what they wanted. It's quicker.

Just text me.
