I'm about to leave for an extended weekend out of town.  I'm taking Richard Branson's advice in his new book "Business Stripped Bare" and I'm throwing a party.  Yup, Saturday night my girlfriend Nan and I are throwing a party.  I invited all my friends and web clients around the world to come.

I love my clients and I want to celebrate with them their businesses.  Business is fantastic and growing and I'm having a blast.  Let's party.

What are you doing to celebrate your achievements?
