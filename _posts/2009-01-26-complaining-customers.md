Virgin has what some are calling the world's best passenger complaint letter floating around.  It's been emailed around the world.  Of course it is very embarrasing for Richard Branson and everyone at Virgin.  They are know for excellent service, but the passenger has some valid points with pictures.

I learn more and fix more from complaining customers.  Of course every business owner wants their product or service to be fantastic so their clients do not have anything to complain about, but if that doesn't happen a complaining customer is fantastic.  At least you know what to fix.

I use to not speak up at restaurants and take what they served.  Then I starting dating my girlfriend Nan and she would speak up.  And she got what she wanted.  I was embarrassed a little the first couple of times but I soon realized that how is the waiter/waitress supposed to know unless you say something.  You speak up, they fix it and everyone is happy.

Paul Charles, Virgin’s Director of Corporate Communications, confirmed that Sir Richard Branson had telephoned the author of the letter and had thanked him for his “constructive if tongue-in-cheek” email. Mr Charles said that Virgin was sorry the passenger had not liked the in-flight meals which he said was “award-winning food which is very popular on our         Indian routes.”

So Richard Branson called the client which was a great move for him to do.  I also think that Richard has launched a look into food quality so this never happens again.
