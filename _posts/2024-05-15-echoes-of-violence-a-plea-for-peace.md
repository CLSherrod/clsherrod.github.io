In the midst of conflict and strife, we often find ourselves grappling with the haunting echoes of history. This poem, "Echoes of Violence: A Plea for Peace," addresses the cyclical nature of violence and the heavy burden of regret that follows. It calls upon us to remember the lessons of the past, to acknowledge the profound impact of our actions, and to strive for a world where justice and peace prevail. As we navigate these challenging times, let this poem serve as a reminder that true strength lies not in perpetuating violence, but in fostering understanding and compassion for all humankind.

## Echoes of Violence: A Plea for Peace

Once the victims, now they stand,
On the opposite side, a troubled land.
Regrets are coming, heavy and thick,
Violence is violence, it's a vicious trick.

Being attacked, it's wrong, we know,
Self-defense is justified, it's the way to go.
But breaking laws, murdering en masse,
That's a holocaust, a shadow we can't bypass.

History echoes, can you hear the call?
Innocents fall, their voices a haunting thrall.
Regrets will come, a weight to bear,
When violence takes hold, does anyone care?

Mass murder stains, deep and wide,
A tragic wound, we can't let slide.
International laws, meant to uphold,
Yet here we stand, in a story retold.

Violence is violence, in any guise,
No matter the reason, it blinds our eyes.
Self-defense, a necessary fight,
But slaughtering innocents? That's never right.

Let history's lessons be our guide,
In the light of peace, let's all reside.
For in the end, what we must find,
Is a world of justice, for all humankind.

So hear this now, a plea, a shout,
We must find a better way out.
Violence begets violence, it's true,
But peace and justice? That's the breakthrough.
