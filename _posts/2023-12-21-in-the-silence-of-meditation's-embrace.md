excerpt: A poem about meditating with the love of my life
---
Just finished a meditation at a Maya ruin and wrote a poem about meditating with the love of my life.

## In the Silence of Meditation's Embrace

In the quiet hush where thoughts dissolve,
A sacred space where the soul revolves.
My wife, a guide in the realm serene,
In meditation's grasp, joy is seen.

She's a weaver of stillness, a tranquil thread,
In the tapestry of chaos, a calming spread.
As she delves within, where echoes cease,
A sanctuary of joy, a haven of peace.

In the depths of silence, profound and clear,
A mirrored lake where truths appear.
Her presence, a balm for the restless mind,
In meditation's embrace, solace we find.

No need for words in this sacred chore,
She journeys within, to her inner core.
And as she dives into the ocean of calm,
Joy emerges like a soothing balm.

In the echoless chambers of mindful repose,
A symphony of tranquility softly flows.
Through her, meditation becomes an art,
Bringing joy from the depths of the heart.

The stillness she finds, a gift she imparts,
In the quiet dance, where awareness starts.
My joy resonates in this silent space,
With my wife mediating, serenity we embrace
