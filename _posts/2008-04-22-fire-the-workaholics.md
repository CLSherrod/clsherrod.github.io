Someone posted that they only hire workaholics (it's a startup, so go figure).  Another CEO then wrote a blog post in response saying fire the workaholics.  I've been a workaholic.  Almost killed me.  Made it out alive.  Then when my best friend died at such a young age my life changed forever.  When you have your life flash before your eyes and you think it is the end of this realm and all you can remember is working (even if inspired work) it's depressing.  I would rather be homeless then be a workaholic.  I enjoy life and funny thing is, I've found that I get more done, more inspiration and I make more money.

Here's another take on that: Fire the people who  *are * workaholics! Here's five reasons why:
- Workaholics may well say that they enjoy those 14 hour days week after week, but despite their claims, working like that all month, all the time is not going to be sustainable. When the burnout crash comes, and it will, it'll hit all the harder and according to Murphy at the least convenient time.
- People who are workaholics are likely to attempt to fix problems by throwing sheer hours at the problem. If you're dealing with people working with anything creatively that's a deadbeat way to get great work done.
- People who always work late makes the people who don't feel inadequate for merely working reasonable hours. That'll lead to guilt, misery, and poor morale. Worse, it'll lead to ass-in-seat mentality where people will stay late out of obligation, but not really be productive.
- If all you do is work, your value judgements are unlikely to be sound. Making good calls on is it worth it? is absolutely critical to great work. Missing out on life in general to put more hours in at the office screams misguided values .
- Working with interesting people is more interesting than just working. If all you got going for your life is work, work, work, the good team-gelling lunches are going to be some pretty boring straight shop talk. Yawn. I'd much rather hear more about your whittling project, your last trek, how your garden is doing, or when you'll get your flight certificate.
