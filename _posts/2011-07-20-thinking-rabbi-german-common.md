Wow, the last couple of days have been fun.

Started off some think time. Then working with a Rabbi and then talked to a German.

I've been using Monday to think. Yup, just sit and look out upon my great view from my office and think. Think about what I want to do this week. Think about what I want to do next month. And think about where I want to be a year from now.

I've really been enjoying just thinking and dreaming about how I really want to live my life.

And I'm making some tweaks as I see them. And things are getting better and better.

And then getting to work with awesome clients around the world is just so cool.

Having a worldwide Internet based business is fun.

I get to learn about different cultures and thoughts and then how they can burst out on the scene and make a name for themselves.

I totally love what I do.

And that is the secret. Totally love what you do and get help on things you don't love.
