I recently took an Improv class. I loved it so much I signed up for the full course which start in a week. What I noticed when doing Improv is it's a lot like doing business.

You have to be okay with improving your way thru it. Your core skill will help but many things are going to be new. Just be your authentic self. And don't care what others think about you. Just go out there and do it. You'll get better. But, you'll suck if you think too much about it.
