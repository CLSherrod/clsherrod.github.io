Leon sent me this tip. Thank Leon. Leon blogs about the managing directors for Richard Branson's Virgin group. A great interview. Enjoy. Link at bottom.

>You may know James Layfield as one of the youngest ever Managing Directors in Richard Branson's Virgin group.

James, named in the Top 30 under 35 UK Entrepreneurs by Growing Business Magazine, caught the entrepreneurial bug from Richard Branson and went on to found youth marketing agency The Lounge Group.
