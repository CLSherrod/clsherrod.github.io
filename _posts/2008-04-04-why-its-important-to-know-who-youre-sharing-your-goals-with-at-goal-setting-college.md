I've had mastermind members (and I was surprised by this) tell me that being successful and not working all the time is bulls**t.  That is my goal and I do pretty good at it.  I'm off for a home exchange for a week and I'm writing this days before so I can enjoy the beach home in Virginia.  

When I first encountered that advice in most self-improvement books, I genuinely thought it was an exaggeration. I even considered it unhealthy. What’s wrong with sharing your ambitious goals with close friends and family? Shouldn't they be happy for you now that you’ve convinced yourself to step out of your comfort zone and pursue something you’ve always wanted? How could they possibly harm someone they claim to love and trust?
