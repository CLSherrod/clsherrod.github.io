I had another Play Prosperity Games Dinner Party Friday night in Austin Texas.
<!--more-->
We had so much fun I forgot to take pictures.

On one of my anonymous feedback forms someone stated that there was too many ideas and to limit it.  I take that as a compliment.  Thank you so much.  I want people to have so many ideas that they pick the one that resonates with them the most.  It is a matter of feeling the inspiration.

“I laughed most of the night with people I just met.  I was happy to help people experience ideas that they may not have thought of on their own.  Chris was very instructive and clear in his prosperity game process.” - Bruce Burns

“I love how everyone contributes in the brainstorming.  This allows for such unique ideas to come forth.  Whenever something is fun, I love it.”

”..helps so much in expanding a few little words into a whole biz vision…interaction with others learning what people around you love…a personal experience for everyone.”

“Meeting new people, thinking creatively, learning how people think.  Seeing what I have in common with others.”

“I like the spontaneity of the game.  The ability to be surprised by what you turn over.  Still being comforted that I knew I liked everything in my cards.  Also liked that this game allows a person to focus on themselves when most of time people are focusing outside themselves (ie work, etc).”
