In business, heck in life, there are a lot of egos. My extended family think parts of the family are idiots and vice versa.

One expert thinks their business model is fantastic and everyone else is a business idiot.

One musician thinks a manager ripped them off.

The list goes on and on.

Forgiveness needs to be hadÂ because being upset or invious with or about others is killing your growth.

Your growth as a business, an expert, a musician and human being.

Forgive, not because they deserve forgiveness...but because you deserve peace.

With peace you can focus, you can grow, you can be successful. With peace you are your ideal self.
