A very interesting study about dyslexia and entrepreneurship.

A new study of entrepreneurs in the United States suggests that dyslexia is much more common among small-business owners than even the experts had thought.

The report, compiled by Julie Logan, a professor of entrepreneurship at the Cass Business School in London, found that more than a third of the entrepreneurs she had surveyed 35 percent identified themselves as dyslexic. The study also concluded that dyslexics were more likely than nondyslexics to delegate authority, to excel in oral communication and problem solving and were twice as likely to own two or more businesses.

We found that dyslexics who succeed had overcome an awful lot in their lives by developing compensatory skills, Professor Logan said in an interview. If you tell your friends and acquaintances that you plan to start a business, you'll hear over and over, It won't work. It can't be done.' But dyslexics are extraordinarily creative about maneuvering their way around problems.

The study was based on a survey of 139 business owners in a wide range of fields across the United States. Professor Logan called the number who said they were dyslexic staggering,â€ and said it was significantly higher than the 20 percent of British entrepreneurs who said they were dyslexic in a poll she conducted in 2001.
