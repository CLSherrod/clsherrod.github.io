I talked to a friend recently that their life wasn't nearly as good as others. And my response was there is no such thing as a life better than yours because you craft your own life. Some things in my life some would think isn't good enough and other would think it's too fancy. And it doesn't matter because it's your life not theirs.

This poem is dedicated to being yourself.

## No Such Thing
No such thing as a life better than yours,
In the heart of your story, where your spirit soars,
Every moment, every breath you take,
Is a piece of the mosaic only you can make.

In the quiet corners of your daily routine,
Lies a beauty profound, often unseen,
In the laughter shared and the tears that fall,
In the love that surrounds you, standing tall.

No such thing as a life better than this,
In the ordinary magic, the simple bliss,
Of waking each morning with hope anew,
In the journey of life that is uniquely you.

For in the tapestry of your days and nights,
Shine the stars of your battles and lights,
No one else can walk the path you tread,
No one else can live the life you've led.

No such thing as a life better than yours,
In the struggles and triumphs, the open doors,
Embrace your story, every twist and turn,
For in your life, so much you learn.

Celebrate the moments, big and small,
For in your life, you have it all,
No such thing as a life better than yours,
In your heart and soul, where your true love pours.
