Many people are living way beyond their means.  Spending more than you make is not being prosperous.  It is not a good idea and will eventually catch up with you.

I’ve found spending a small percentage on fun stuff and as a reward to projects or deals closing to really work for me.  It helps insure I don’t over spend and yet I get my toys and have fun.  The more prosperous I am the more fun I have.
