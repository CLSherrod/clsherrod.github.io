**If you’ve ever rolled your eyes at “let’s circle back” or groaned through a Zoom filled with buzzwords, *Corp-bonics* belongs on your desk.**

Anthony Kates’ *[Corp-bonics: A Comprehensive Field Guide to Unpacking the Buzzwords of the Modern Day Workplace](https://amzn.to/4erOkku)* is part dictionary, part satire, and part survival manual for anyone who’s had to navigate the strange theater of modern office communication.

## Corporate Speak Is a Language—This Book Translates It

Most of us have worked in environments where clarity gets sacrificed for sounding “professional.” Instead of saying what we mean, we hide behind vague phrases like:

- “Let’s take this offline”
- “Touch base”
- “Leverage synergies”
- “Just checking in…”

We know what they *really* mean, and so does Anthony Kates. This book decodes over **400 of the most common corporate terms**, explaining not just their surface definitions, but the subtext behind them. It also rates how annoying they’ve become, which—frankly—feels long overdue.

## It’s More Than Just a Glossary. It’s Therapy.

You’ll find:

- Hilarious office archetypes like *The KPI Whisperer*
- Satirical tools like *Meeting Bingo* and *Email Translation 101*
- A reminder that you’re not the only one thinking, “Wait, did we actually say anything useful in that meeting?”

It’s funny, yes—but also strangely healing. Especially if you’ve been stuck in work cultures that favor noise over meaning.

## Who Should Read *Corp-bonics*?

This book is for:

- New hires trying to survive their first week
- Burned-out managers craving clarity
- Teams looking for the perfect onboarding gift
- Anyone who’s ever received a “per my last email” and wanted to scream

## Final Takeaway: You’re Not Crazy—The System Is

What I appreciated most is the quiet permission this book gives to speak more plainly, more honestly, and with a little more humor.

**If you’ve ever felt like the workplace speaks a different language, this book will make you feel seen—and it’ll make you laugh.**

Highly recommended. Not just for the laughs, but for the clarity it brings in a world full of corporate fog.
