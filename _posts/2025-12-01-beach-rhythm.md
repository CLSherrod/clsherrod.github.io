## When a Peaceful Morning Isn’t Peaceful

Most days, living on the beach feels like a gift wrapped in light: soft mornings, quiet air, a horizon so wide it feels like a doorway. I moved here for that peace, and most mornings deliver it faithfully.

Then there are mornings like today.

Wind tore through overnight, and by sunrise six palm branches lay scattered across the sand. Six coconuts too—half of them rolled straight into the pool I had cleaned just two days ago. It made me laugh in that resigned, knowing way you laugh when life nudges another small chore onto your list.

Standing there with a skimmer in my hand, I could feel how this place has changed me. Beach living forces you to pay attention to weather—because weather shapes your day whether you like it or not.

## Life in the Waves: Calm, Chaos, and the Truth Between Them

Some mornings the sea looks like a still lake. Other days it rears up into steep walls of water that only expert surfers dare to test. Even they don’t enjoy it much when it gets like that.

But the lesson that keeps coming back to me is simple:

**The rhythm matters more than the extremes.**  
The gentle rise and fall.  
The small shifts that require awareness, not alarm.

I used to chase one extreme or the other. I wanted life perfectly calm or thrilling enough to distract me from everything else. But living by the water shows me how temporary both experiences are. Calm visits. Chaos visits. Neither stays.

What stays is the rhythm underneath it all.

## The Middle Space Is Where Real Life Lives

When branches fall and coconuts splash into the pool, I’m reminded I don’t need perfect circumstances to feel grounded. I need a healthy relationship with the day I’m actually living. I need space to let small messes exist without declaring life broken. I need space for the joy that slips in between the disruptions.

Real life lives in **gentle fluctuation**—not stillness, not storm, but the middle space. The space where breath steadies and reactions soften.

If you feel pushed around by your own version of wind or waves, pause for a moment. Look for the rhythm underneath everything. It might be a routine. It might be a relationship that stays kind. It might simply be your breath.

Follow that rhythm instead of the chaos.

It will hold you better than any illusion of perfect conditions ever could.

## The Wind Settles Eventually

The pool can wait. The chores can wait. For now, I’m listening to the wind ease its shoulders and the ocean roar a little louder than usual. None of it ruins the day. It’s just part of the rhythm I live inside.

And the rhythm is always there—steady, quiet, waiting to be noticed.
