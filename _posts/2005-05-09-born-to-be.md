excerpt: My review of the book Born To Be
---
I read many business and self-development books. Some are better than others. This book [Born To Be](https://amzn.to/4cCTTuC) is one of the best. *Born To Be* tells several stories of well-known people that have failed and succeeded. Great stories with great reminders that they had several failures before winning and they did so because they didn’t give up. Don’t give up and I’ll see you at the top.

Have you ever wondered, “Is this all there is?” Are you tired of feeling trapped in a stress-filled job that leaves you unhappy and unfulfilled? If so, you are not alone; 86 percent of Americans aren’t happy with their jobs. Fortunately, Brian Souza’s cutting-edge new book offers a simple solution. *Become Who You Were Born to Be: We All Have a Gift… Have You Discovered Yours?* It explores the tragedy of an unlived life. It provides straightforward strategies to help people discover their gifts and uncover their purpose in life. This book couldn’t have come at a better time.
