This is only my second Valentine's Day with someone special in my life.  Yeah believe it or not the rest of my life I didn't have someone special in my life when today came up.

I never went out during Valentine's Day.  I usually stayed home and thought about anything else.   Now I'm now one of the crowd that goes out for that special dinner.  We are going to the best restraurant in town and walk on the beach.

But before I go off to be with my honey I wanted to share with you some thoughts.

Live life with passion.  Don't take anything at all for granted.  I am so thrilled to be with my Nan everyday, day in and day out.  I'm trilled with my life.

Appreciate what you have and always strive for more.  You are an amazing individual.  Treat yourself well and others around you.

Happy Valentines Day
