I got a button that simply says "Feel Good Button" on it for my birthday.

When you press it, it plays James Brown "I Feel Good" song for a few seconds.

We are in Port Aransas Texas on vacation (it's my birthday week) and when ever we go by the button we just hit it. Life is as simple as pressing a button to feel good and this button has shown that to me even more. And of course a nice vacation helps.
I learned some mental techniques to choose happiness from <a href="http://www.abraham-hicks.com" rel="nofollow">Abraham-Hicks</a> and still use those techniques today.

Simply choose to be happy. Life is great and I'm having a blast.
