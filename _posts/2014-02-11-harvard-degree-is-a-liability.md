excerpt: Why a Harvard Degree is a liability.
---
The most popular article I've written is [High School Dropouts Are More Successful](/high-school-dropouts-are-more-successful/) that lists a very long list of dropouts that are very wealthy. In my conclusion I said:

> More education doesn’t mean you’ll be more successful. It’s all about your drive. Your passion in life and sticking to it. Not necessarily playing it safe.  I’ve meet many people that have played it safe, with a good job and such and then retire broke.  Don’t play it safe.  Go for it like these people have.

On Sunday at Harvard Chamath Palihapitiya, the founder of the venture capital fund Social+Capital Partnership gave a wake up call to elite entrepreneurs.

A prominent start-up investor had a sobering message for the elite entrepreneurs of Harvard: You are at a disadvantage when it comes to attracting capital.

“It’s really unfair to you guys, but I think you’re discriminated against now,” Chamath Palihapitiya, the founder of the venture capital fund Social+Capital Partnership, said at a conference organized by the business school’s venture capital and private equity club.

Referring to his colleagues in the venture capital industry, he added, “I would bet a large amount of money that the overwhelming majority of us would not look favorably on a company started by one of you.”

You don't have to be an elite tech founder/investor. You just need a cool idea and market it. The marketing of it is the most important part by far.

If you don't know how to market, partner with someone that does. Almost everything I've done in business has been a partnership. You need to structure it right but it's a great way to take advantage of everyone's strengths. All of corporate America is a partnership of some type, where different people are doing different things.

And as the founder of a company/idea you can't do everything, just enough to get started and off the ground. Whether your the techy or the marketing person, you can be successful by going out that and selling what you got and moving forward every day.
