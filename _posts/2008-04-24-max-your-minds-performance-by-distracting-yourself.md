Cool mind hacks for maximum performance.

>The trick is to distract yourself by studying stuff thats slightly different from whatever youre trying to learn. Your brain will then work harder to permanently store the original information. Its a tricky concept, but heres an example: In 2007, researchers asked UCLA students to try to memorize a set of 48 word pairs country: Russia, fruit: lemon, flower: lily, etc.. After studying the list, some students then had to sit through a slide show and view closely related material flower: rose. Guess what? The distracted students performed better on subsequent recall tests. "Distraction forces you to engage in processing," says Benjamin Storm, a UCLA researcher who oversaw the study.
