Saturday I firewalked for the first and second time. Michael Eckerman had a [firewalking seminar](http://firewalkaustin.com/). Michael is a Certified Firewalk Instructor certified by the Firewalking Institute of Research and Education (F.I.R.E) and a Master Trainer in Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP), a certified and seasoned professional in Time Line TherapyÂ®, an expert in Neuro-Sciences, and is accomplished and certified in Hypnosis.

After a great seminar of anchoring and envisioning we moved outside for the firewalk.

Michael is having another [firewalk at end of this month](http://firewalkaustin.com/). Come on by Austin and let's walk on fire together. His seminar has some amazing techniques and it was a blast to walk on fire with my girlfriend.

The rest of the weekend both of us would just strut and say "I walked on fire". Highly recommended if you're a couple to do together.
