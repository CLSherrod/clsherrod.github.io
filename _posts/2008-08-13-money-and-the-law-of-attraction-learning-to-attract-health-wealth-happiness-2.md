Esther and Jerry Hicks really helped me a few years ago. I went to one of their small workshops that they had on their ranch and it made a signifant change in my and my life turned around. I saw the first three people get in the hot seat in from of Abraham and tell them that the teachings of Abraham brought them success and happiness and thank you. I thought the entire workshop was going to be people looking for guidance and how screwed up their lives were. Some did but overall it was very positive. After that workshop my life changed all for the better. Now they are coming out with a book on Money and Law of Attraction. Can't wait to read this one.

>This is the original source material for the current Law of Attraction wave that is sweeping the world, and it is the 21st century inspiration for thousands of books, films, essays and lectures that are responsible for the current paradigm shift in consciousness. Here you will find accurate clarification of the basics of the Law of Attraction and practical applications as well as up-to-the-moment leading-edge expanding information regarding the Law of Attraction. (Also known as "The Teachings of Abraham") This is the fountainhead of the information upon which the hit movie, The Secret was based. Learning to Attract Health, Wealth & Happiness Abraham's newest book explains that the two subjects most chronically affected by the powerful Law of Attraction are financial and physical well-being. It shines a spotlight on each of the most significant aspects of your life experience and then guides you to the conscious creative control of every aspect of your life. It also goes right to the heart of what most are probably troubled by: Money and physical health. Not having enough money or not having good health puts you in the perfect position for creating more of that which you do not have. This book has been written to deliberately align you with the most powerful Law in the Universe ”the Law of Attraction ”so that you can make it work specifically for you.
