A friend recommended that I read [Nobody Wants To Read Your Sh*t](https://amzn.to/3SOgFaT), and I didn’t take it as an insult. I’ve had my share of hits and misses with my writing, so I was intrigued that someone tackled this topic head-on.

I ended up loving the book and highly recommend it. The author’s diverse background in marketing, screenwriting, and novel writing gives him unique insights into what it really takes to capture and hold a reader’s attention.

He doesn’t sugarcoat it:

> "Recognizing this painful truth is the first step in the writer's transformation from amateur to professional."

> "What *Nobody Wants to Read Your Shit* means is that none of us wants to hear your self-centered, ego-driven, unrefined demands for attention. Why should we? It’s boring. There’s nothing in it for us."

I loved how he applied storytelling to self-help books:
> ..as other types of nonfiction, self-help can be treated as story and be conceived and structured in accord with storytelling principles.

This book is a must-read for anyone serious about writing and connecting with an audience.
