The first time I went out of the house on Black Friday I had no idea it was the most popular shopping day of the year.  I was new to Phoenix Arizona and before when I lived in Alaska shopping was 45 minutes away if the weather was ideal.  So I never knew about Black Friday until I showed up at the biggest mall in Arizona.  Oh did I mention that I wasn't use to crowds.  I came back home with nothing and stressed.  Never went out on Black Friday again.

Even though I can do crowds now I don't like wasting my time in lines so I get online.  Here are some great Black Friday deal hunter websites.  Enjoy.
