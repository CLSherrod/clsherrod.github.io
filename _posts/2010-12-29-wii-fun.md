I have finally found how to get respect from our kids.

<Beat their little butts on the Wii. Yup, when I beat them in their current favorite video game of the moment they respected me.

"You have some skills Chris" one daughter told me.

I told her I had some other skills in business that people respect me in, but she didn't care. It's all about what she found impressive of me.

So what are you good at that people haven't seen? Show off.

Now off to keep my reputation up, by practicing on the Wii.
