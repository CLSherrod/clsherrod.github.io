excerpt: Poem about not fearing death.
---
I don’t fear death. Five years after a life changing seizure I finally feel ready to die. I’ve finally figured out who I am. I know my place in the universe. I see the beginning and the end. I am loved and have loved. I would be missed and that makes it all worth while. I don’t know when my end will be on this mortal earth but I will continue until the last day and hopefully beyond.

I took this feeling and wrote a poem.

## Embracing Mortality: A Journey of Discovery

In the embrace of time, I stand,
Five years since fate's unseen hand.
A life-changing seizure, a journey begun,
I've faced my fears, I've felt the sun.

Death's shadow looms, yet I'm not afraid,
For in its grasp, I've found my shade.
I've unearthed the depths of who I am,
In the cosmic dance, I've found my jam.

I see the beginning and the end,
In the cycles of life, where ebb and blend.
I've tasted love, I've felt its grace,
In the embrace of time, in every space.

Though mortal, I am, I feel the call,
To journey onward, to give my all.
I am loved, I have loved, that much is clear,
In the tapestry of life, I hold dear.

I know not when my end will be,
But until then, I'll live boldly, free.
For in the journey, in the here and now,
I find purpose, I find my vow.

So let the days unfold, let time take flight,
I'll walk this path, with all my might.
For in the end, when my time draws nigh,
I'll embrace the unknown, with a grateful sigh.
