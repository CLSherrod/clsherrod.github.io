The answer is always no if you don't ask.  I've seen this many times.  This is why I simply ask.

I ask for new clients from past clients and from my audience.

I ask for what I want. If I don't ask I don't get it.

I use to be shy....actually painfully shy. Sometime I am still but not often. I got over a vast majority of it because I wanted stuff that I saw others getting easily just by asking. So I started asking. People are flattered when asked. They want to get you what you want.

Asking is fun and it pays great dividends. Nan and I love to ask for extra things when at restaurants, seminars, companies, massage therapists and others. Ask for what you want and it is amazing how easy you get it.

Don't be silent. Ask and you shall receive.
