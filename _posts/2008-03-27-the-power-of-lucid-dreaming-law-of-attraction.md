I have many dreams of what to do next.  It is very common for me.  The are detailed and very inspiring.  Here is an article on lucid dreaming that helps explain what naturally occurs to me.

>So, what is **Lucid Dreaming**? The simplest way I can think (right now) is, **Lucid Dreaming** is a method to program your dream.

Focus on what you want to dream just right before you sleep and it will appear in your dream.

Think of a problem you want to solve. Focus on finding the solution when you are about to sleep and when you sleep, your subconscious mind will travel around and find the solution for you and it will come to you through your dream.

Have you ever heard people say, I'll sleep on it (the problem)?
