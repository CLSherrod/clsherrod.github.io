Are you doing inspired action or are you just working to pay for everything?  Are you a work-a-holic? Do you think you have to work all the time? I use to. It didn't work for me. I didn't have time to enjoy life. I didn't have time to think. I didn't have time to let inspiration come to me. I failed. Repeatly. And it wasn't fun. I now focus on what I want to get done and not all of it is business. I am more successful now.
