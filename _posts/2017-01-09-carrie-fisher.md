excerpt: Carrie Fisher my first feminist role model.

My article about Carrie Fisher was picked up by Good Men Project.

Carrie Fisher and her *Star Wars* character defined the type of woman I wanted to be with at an early age when I saw Star Wars when I was 7.

<p>Read my article [Carrie Fisher: My First Feminist Role Model on Good Men Project](https://goodmenproject.com/ethics-values/carrie-fisher-my-first-feminist-role-model-bbab/).

Rest In Peace Carrie Fisher.
