In order to be an expert you have to really be an expert. You have to know more about your subject matter than most of the planet. And you need to set the standard. You need to be the best.

When you are setting the standard and focusing on being the best, people notice. Don't try to compete with the people that are trying to do it for the cheapest possible, you can't win at that game. Heck, they aren't going to win. They'll go out of business it's just a matter of time.

Be the person that people compare to. Do your best and provide an experience that everyone else strives for.

Set the standard. That's an expert. That's something you can build a brand on.
