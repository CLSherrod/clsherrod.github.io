For a long time, I thought investing was about choosing the right thing.

The right stock.  
The right moment.  
The right insight no one else had yet.

Over time, I learned that most of that effort was misplaced.

What matters far more than selection or timing is something quieter and less exciting: **asset allocation** — how your money is spread across different types of assets, and whether that balance is maintained with intention.

Most long-term outcomes are shaped there, not in clever moves.

> 92% of your return is determined by asset allocation, 6% my manager/stock selection, and 2% by timing.
## The Part People Ignore

Asset allocation forces you to confront restraint.

When you rebalance, you’re doing something that feels almost backwards: buying what’s out of favor and trimming what’s already been rewarded. It’s uncomfortable precisely because it resists momentum.

Most people don’t fail because they chose badly.  
They fail because they followed enthusiasm too far.

I’ve seen lives built around a single rising asset collapse when that one pillar gave way. The damage rarely stays financial. It spills into stress, relationships, health, and the quiet sense of safety people mistake for success.

This is the cost of imbalance.
## Risk Isn’t a Number — It’s a Feeling

Everyone believes they understand their risk tolerance.

They usually don’t.

You only learn it when the numbers move against you and the noise gets loud. If an investment strategy requires constant checking, reassurance, or explanation, it’s already too aggressive — no matter how rational it looked on paper.

The same principle shows up elsewhere in life.  
I’ve written about this in [Finding Balance: Why Extreme Mindsets Don’t Lead to Entrepreneurial Success](https://christophersherrod.com/finding-balance/) where the problem isn’t effort, but sustainability.

What you can live with matters more than what looks optimal.

## Simplicity Has Leverage

Mark Cuban once said that you should never put money somewhere you don’t have an information advantage.

> **CUBAN:** Put it in the bank. The idiots that tell you to put your money in the market because eventually it will go up need to tell you that because they are trying to sell you something. The stock market is probably the worst investment vehicle out there. If you won’t put your money in the bank, NEVER put your money in something where you don’t have an information advantage. Why invest your money in something because a broker told you to? If the broker had a clue, he/she wouldn’t be a broker, they would be on a beach somewhere.

Most people don’t have one.

Which is why simple, diversified approaches quietly outperform complex strategies over time. Not because they’re smarter — but because they remove emotion, ego, and unnecessary decisions.

This mirrors a broader theme I return to often, including in [Why Successful People Don’t Waste Time Arguing](https://christophersherrod.com/arguing/). Energy conserved is energy available elsewhere.

Cleverness burns fuel.  
Structure saves it.
## Looking Back

Eventually, I simplified even further.

I stopped trying to manage the details and let systems handle allocation and rebalancing automatically. Fewer decisions. Less noise. More room to think clearly about the rest of life.

That same shift — away from constant intervention — shows up in how I approach work, technology, and attention now. It’s part of what led me to write about **living a fulfilling life**, rather than chasing outcomes that look good from the outside but feel brittle up close.

## Recommendation
My current asset allocation for my investments are on [WealthFront](http://wlth.fr/1SldB0I). A few years ago I liquidated all my stocks and put them in WealthFront to manage for me. WealthFront handles getting the stocks, REITs, and bonds. Using tools that only billionaires had access to in the past.

Goto [WealthFront](http://wlth.fr/1SldB0I) that is an affiliate link and you can get $5,000 managed for free. After that it is a super low fee better by far than any other method.
