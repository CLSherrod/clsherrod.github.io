excerpt: Poem about enjoying the silence.
---
I was sitting in my hot tub watching the palm trees sway and the ocean waves, and I think what can I write about. I'm happy, wrote about that before, I don't want to repeat myself too much. I've even written about sitting in my hot tub and listening to chill out music and just enjoying the view. So, I thought, why not write about just the joy of silence.

## Silent Joy

In the silence of contentment, words fade away,
Nothing left to speak, on this bright, perfect day.
Happiness envelopes me, a gentle, warm embrace,
No need for conversation, just peace in this space.

No troubled thoughts to utter, no burdens to release,
In the calm of my heart, there resides a quiet peace.
Laughter fills the moments, light dances in my eyes,
A joy so complete, it renders words unwise.

The world spins softly, in a rhythm sweet and slow,
Beneath the skyâ€™s vast canvas, where gentle breezes blow.
In the garden of my soul, blooms serenity so rare,
With nothing to declare, but gratitude so fair.

So I sit in this stillness, with a smile soft and true,
Letting happiness speak in the silent things I do.
For sometimes joy is quiet, a whisper in the air,
A simple, silent presence, that words cannot compare.
