I absolutely love Internet Marketers.

Simply because we create solutions that are needed.

I recently had a problem in my business. What I have been doing for years just wasn't working anymore.

My business had grown to a level that what I use to do was totally inadequate. Big time.

I got really overwhelmed because of it. I had to hire and help my partner with assistant stuff, which I really dislike (aka hate).

I was having some issues with the assistant for my partner. They couldn't keep up with her. She moves fast and a regular virtual assistant wasn't cutting it.

I needed to hire someone better that could keep up with my partner.

So I did what I always did, the same hire process I've used for the past 5 years. The next person lasted 3 days before quitting.

Damn, and I had a good hiring process, Top Grading, screening out process, interviews.

This wasn't working.

I knew of a hiring manager but I didn't want to budget for it just for an assistant.

So I looked for some help on hiring people online.

I found a video course on hiring. I bought it, watched the videos in less than an hour and implemented what I learned in another hour.

It worked. It was better than what I had. I've hired two people using the process.

I'm grateful for the help. It has saved my company a lot of time and money.

And this isn't something I could buy in a book. It would be outdated quickly. And I love video or audio, it's quicker. Much much quicker.

I can find, buy, and start learning in about two minutes. It makes traditional "degrees" almost pointless (they are good for getting connections to people, but so is buying a beer at a pub for someone).

So thank you from one Internet Marketing CEO to good content making Internet Marketers. Please keep providing relevant and timely training that bring a return on investment.
