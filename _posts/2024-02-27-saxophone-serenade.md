excerpt: Poem about the love of the saxophone.

Went to a live Jazz Festival here in Yucatán México and had fun enjoying the music while on the beach for sunset. So wrote a poem.

## Saxophone Serenade: Jazz on the Yucatán Beach

Under the Yucatán sky, as the sun begins to set,
A jazz festival unfolds, a scene we won't forget.
With the rhythm of the waves and the music in the air,
We dance upon the sands, without a single care.

The saxophone wails, the trumpet sings its tune,
As the melodies intertwine, beneath the crescent moon.
Guitars strum softly, drums keep the beat,
In this symphony of jazz, our souls find retreat.

The salty breeze whispers secrets in our ears,
As we sway to the music, releasing all our fears.
The golden hues of sunset paint the sky above,
A backdrop of beauty for this festival of love.

With toes in the sand and laughter in our eyes,
We lose ourselves in the music, under starlit skies.
For in this moment, on this beach so grand,
We find joy in the music, hand in hand.

So let the jazz play on, as the night draws near,
In the Yucatán's embrace, we'll linger here.
For in this fusion of music and sea,
We find magic in the moment, wild and free.
