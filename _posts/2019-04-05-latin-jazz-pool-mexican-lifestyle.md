excerpt: My last day in Playa del Carmen.
---
Yesterday was my last day in Progreso Mexico and another excellent sunrise at 5:50.

And the night before that I accidently found an excellent Indian restaurant while walking to another place.

Playa del Carmen doesn't have an Indian restaurant and I haven't had any in like three years.

So I ate there immediately.

Then another walk on the beach during sunset.

Here's my honey posing on the boardwalk.

Then I was off to Merida, Yucatan, Mexico for an extended weekend before going back home to Playa del Carmen.

Merida once was the 5th richest city in the world. So there is lots of old money here.

And it's super hip.

A bit hot, like 34 degrees celius which is like 91 degrees F.

So I hit the private pool in my AirBnb to cool with Apple Music Latin Jazz station.

Uber, Uber Eats, and tons of cool museaums and events happening.

I'm off to enjoy this fantastic city.
