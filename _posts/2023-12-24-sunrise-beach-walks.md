excerpt: Poem about sunrise beach walks with my love
---
I love sunrise beach walks with my love. Living another day with my love in a place that totally fits us feels like a miracle. I feel lucky. And that it was a lot of focusing on how to make things better day by day. So I wrote a poem.

## Sunrise Beach Walks

In the hush of dawn, where the ocean meets the light,
A canvas of dreams painted in hues so bright.
Hand in hand, my love and I embrace,
Sunrise beach walks, a serene, tranquil space.

The horizon blushes with the first kiss of day,
As waves whisper secrets, carried away.
Footprints left in the soft morning sand,
A journey of love, a path so grand.

The sun ascends, a golden sphere,
Casting a glow, dispelling all fear.
In the soft, grainy tapestry beneath our feet,
The world awakens, a heartbeat sweet.

Seagulls, like poets, in the morning sky,
Chant verses of freedom as they soar high.
With each step, the worries subside,
In the dance of the waves, love is our guide.

The salty breeze, a tender caress,
As the sun paints the waves with a golden dress.
Pure bliss in each moment, a sunrise embrace,
As we stroll together, finding solace and grace.

The symphony of morning, a melody so sweet,
Our hearts in rhythm with the ocean's heartbeat.
Sunrise beach walks, where time takes a pause,
A canvas of love painted with nature's laws.

Hand in hand, beneath the sky's soft kiss,
These sunrise beach walks, pure bliss.
In the quiet of dawn, where love softly speaks,
Each step is a poem, each moment, a peak.
