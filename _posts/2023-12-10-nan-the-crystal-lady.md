My house with my love Nan is full of crystals. We have big crystals on shelves and garden areas. I can turn my head and count nearly one-hundred crystals. So Nan is my crystal lady. So, I wrote a poem about her and her crystals.

## Nan, the Crystal Lady

In the realm of love, where hearts align,
There's Nan, my wife, a gem so fine.
A crystal lady with an inner glow,
A radiant light that continues to grow.

Her essence sparkles, a crystal clear,
In the tapestry of love, she's always near.
A luminous grace, a gentle guide,
In her presence, love and light coincide.

Her laughter, a melody of pure delight,
Echoes like crystals catching the light.
With every smile, she illuminates,
A radiant aura that resonates.

In the dance of life, she gracefully moves,
A crystal lady whose spirit soothes.
Her kindness, a prism of colors bright,
Dispelling darkness with love's own light.

A gem in the rough, polished by years,
Each facet of Nan, it appears.
Her warmth, a glow that gently sears,
A beacon of love that perseveres.

So here's to Nan, the crystal so rare,
With a light that permeates the air.
In love's embrace, forever she glows,
A crystal lady, whose light forever flows.
