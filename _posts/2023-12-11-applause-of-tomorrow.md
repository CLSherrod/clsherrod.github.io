excerpt: Poem about my future self looking back at me now.
---
I sometimes feel unheard. After my seizures and being isolated from electronics, light and noise for many months and the slow and ongoing return to normal I feel like Iâ€™m my future self looking back at me now and appreciateing the journey. So I wrote a poem about that feeling.

## Applause of Tomorrow

In the hushed auditorium of the present,
I stand amidst the shadows, a lone crescent.
No applause graces my current stage,
Yet in the silence, a promise engages.

The world, perhaps, is yet to see,
The version of me I'm destined to be.
Noticed now by only a patient few,
In the cocoon of anonymity, I accrue.

The applause of tomorrow echoes afar,
A symphony awaiting its guiding star.
The seeds of effort planted today,
In the future, will bloom in a grand display.

Quiet steps on an unnoticed path,
In the mosaic of time, a prelude to aftermath.
The world may not yet hear my song,
But the melody within continues strong.

Applause withheld in this muted hour,
Yet I persist, gathering strength and power.
For the spotlight may delay its gleam,
But the applause of tomorrow is a vibrant dream.

In the tapestry of time, patience is a thread,
Woven into the journey where dreams are bred.
So, applaud the future me, yet unseen,
For in this moment's quiet, resilience convenes.

A silent ovation in the wings I find,
A promise that resonates in the heart and mind.
For the applause of tomorrow, a distant cheer,
Is the echo of the steps taken here.
