The Wonder Woman movie is a huge sign that people want things that matter. It isn’t all about how fast the superhero can fight. It’s about doing the right thing and doing it well.

The director of the movie wanted this film to be the best superhero movie, not the best women lead superhero movie directed by a woman. But the best superhero movie. Big difference. Doing the right thing like have a woman power affirming movie that influences women and especially girls to know they can be the hero, they can be anything they want to be. But, it won’t have the impact if the movie wasn’t done really really well. And it was.

**Spoiler alert below.**

What makes this movie different than any other superhero movie is love. The two main characters fall in love. Love is the basis of her core belief. Sure she kicks bad guy ass and does it with flair, it’s amazing. But, a superhero that talks about love? That’s never been done like this.

Hollywood will take notice. Woman and men have shown that they are willing to spend a lot of money on films made by women, about women.

And business take notes, doing the right thing makes money because people want the right thing done and are willing to pay for it.

Can’t wait for Wonder Woman 2.
