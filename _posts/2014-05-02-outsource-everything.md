I celebrated my birthday last week. Thai massage, comedy club, meals with friends, trip to a safari park with the family, resort, another massage, champagne, chocolate covered strawberries, on and on. I need a vacation from my vacation to recover.

But seriously, it was my best birthday yet. I want to think my family and friends for the amazing time. Especially my love Nan.

I’ve had the privilege of getting to be with her, she is so amazing.

With our business I’ve been perfecting outsourcing and have an amazing team.

We had close to a record week while I was partying and enjoying my birthday week.

Nan focuses on connecting with her audience. I focus on having the business run smoothly.

So I've hired assistants, tech people, transcribers, marketing help, graphic designers, traffic generators, maids, handymen ( I have no idea how to fix anything in my home ), mechanics ( ditto for cars, double ditto actually ), private tutors for our daughter, lawyers, accountants, financial advice and tons more. I outsource almost everything except my sex life because…well duh and exercise because I haven't figured out how to get someone else to do it for me.

I've had an assistant since 2000, over 14 years and I enjoy directing and leading my team.

I focus on actually not doing anything but telling people what to do, training, operating procedures. Finding the best way to get things done.

I thought it was boring and nobody wanted to hear about it.

Nan got all the attention speaking and writing and I sat around on my iPhone directing and reading a lot.

Not exactly sexy.

But at the resort I just got back from I was encouraged to share my lifestyle as I was sipping a fine Merlot at the pool overlooking the golf course. And I got a new client at the same time.

I’m thankful for my business, it takes good care of me.
