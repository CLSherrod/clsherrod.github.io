The second Play Prosperity Games dinner was a huge hit.  Feedback is great.  Everyone really enjoyed the game we played.  And the ideas were great and based on what people love.  Some truly great ideas were created.  I look forward to people implementing them and then I’ll let you all know about them.

Based on the fantastic feedback.  We will be having more in the future.  And scaling up.

“This is a fascinating tool for brainstorming.  Creative ideas, concepts and exploration.” - Henry Novak
