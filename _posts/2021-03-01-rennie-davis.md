Rennie Davis was never content to simply talk about change—he lived it, breathed it, and invited others to join him. Known first as one of the Chicago Seven, he carried the torch of the 1960s counterculture into the 21st century with undiminished conviction. But what made Rennie extraordinary wasn’t just his history of protest—it was how he evolved beyond it.

I had the rare honor of helping him self-publish his final book, [The New Humanity: A Movement to Change the World](https://amzn.to/43pJEHH). That experience gave me a glimpse into his mind not as a historical figure, but as a man devoted to humanity’s next awakening.

## A Lifetime of Activism and Awakening

In the turbulent 1960s, Rennie became a household name as one of the Chicago Seven—activists tried for protesting the Vietnam War at the 1968 Democratic National Convention. While others faded into history, Rennie transformed.

He shifted from political rebellion to inner revolution, believing that personal awakening was the true foundation for global change. His journey took him from the front lines of protest to the quiet clarity of spiritual practice.

And yet, the core remained the same: a fierce belief that people can—and must—rise to a higher state of consciousness.

## The Birth of The New Humanity

When Rennie and I worked together to help him self-publish *The New Humanity*, it was more than a book project—it was a mission. He wanted to bridge activism and spirituality, blending the energy of social movements with the wisdom of inner transformation.

Rennie didn’t write like a guru or a politician. He wrote like a man who had seen both the power and the pitfalls of movements, and who still chose to believe in love as the ultimate revolution.

Helping him bring that vision to life reminded me that publishing, at its best, is service—helping an idea find its voice in the world.

## A Vision That Outlives Him

Rennie passed away in 2021, but his message endures. *The New Humanity* isn’t just the title of his book—it’s a prophecy for those ready to create a world rooted in consciousness, compassion, and courage.

He envisioned communities built not on ideology, but on shared purpose. He believed humanity’s next chapter wouldn’t be written by governments or corporations—but by ordinary people choosing to live extraordinary values.

## Carrying Forward Rennie’s Light

To have known and worked with Rennie Davis was to witness a rare integrity of spirit. He stood at the crossroads of history and future, rebellion and peace, mind and heart.

His words, his life, and his final book remind us that transformation isn’t a slogan—it’s a way of being.

If you ever doubt that one person can change the world, remember Rennie. He already did.
