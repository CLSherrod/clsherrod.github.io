excerpt: Poem about being gratiful for life.
---
In the dance of existence, amidst the ebb and flow of life's unpredictable currents, there exists a profound sense of gratitude for the simple miracle of being alive. This poem was born from the depths of a grateful heart. It celebrates the sheer wonder of existence and the unspoken blessings that grace our journey. Join me as we embark on a lyrical exploration of the beauty found in every breath, every heartbeat, and every moment of being truly alive.

## Alive in Gratitude: A Hymn to Life

Thank God I'm still alive,
In the dawn's gentle light,
Each breath, a whisper of grace,
In this sacred embrace.

Through trials and strife, I've trod,
Yet here I stand, blessed by God.
In the face of darkness, I thrive,
Thankful for the gift of being alive.

Though storms may rage, and winds may howl,
I cling to hope, my spirit's prow.
For every sunrise, every dawn,
Is a testament to life reborn.

In the quiet of the night's embrace,
I offer gratitude for each day's grace.
For every heartbeat, every sigh,
Is a hymn to life, a lullaby.

Thank God I'm still alive,
In the depths of joy, I strive.
With each moment, I'll strive to thrive,
Thankful for the gift of being alive.
