I've traveled a lot. Went to France and Venice Italy last summer. London, Paris and Edinburgh the summer before that, and Panama the summer before that. I've traveled and still did business.

It's about working inspired.

It's NOT about working to prove something.

It's about having a lifestyle that fulfills you.

It's NOT about building empires or having more "stuff".

It's about the rich experiences in life.

It's NOT about getting rich.

It's about having a business that provides you income.

It's NOT about having a business that provides you a JOB.

You know there are people that will not desire this life, and that's ok...

Because you and I know, having the freedom to experience this life, all the majestic places, and interesting people that make up our planet, is to have real abundance and wealth.
