excerpt: Poem about the present, the now, what you are actually living is a gift, a present.
---
The present, the now, what you are actually living is a gift, a present. I loved that it's the same word. The present is a real present. Enjoy every moment. I wrote a poem to remember to enjoy the moments.

## Moments Unwrapped: The Present ‚è∞ is Your Present üéÅ

In the quiet of now, where moments unfold,
The present is your present, a treasure untold.
It's a gift of now presence, a sacred embrace,
A chance to find solace, in life's endless race.

No need to chase after what's yet to come,
Or linger on memories, lost and undone.
For in the present, there's magic to find,
A symphony of moments, gentle and kind.

In the present, there's joy to be found,
In the simple pleasures that surround.
It's the laughter of loved ones, the warmth of the sun,
A reminder that life is a journey, not yet done.

So let us embrace the present, with hearts open wide,
Let's savor each moment, let's enjoy the ride.
For in the now, there's wonder to see,
The present is your present, a gift, truly.
