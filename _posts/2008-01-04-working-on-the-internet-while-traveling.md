I'm traveling and we just moved into another condo for a month.  At first the Internet looked fine then I started to have some issues.

If you are like me and need to FTP and login to web server backends (not your content management system) places like here block them.

Call the office and talk to the head techy or in this case a contractor and ask for them to open up what you need access to.  Andrew did that for me and now all my tools work.  I uploaded a new training video for my subscribers as soon as Andrew punched a hole in his firewall.

So if your tools don't work ask for them to fix them.
