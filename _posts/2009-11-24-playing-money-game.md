If you lose all your money, it sucks. But, it's not the end of the world. You get another opportunity to get right back in the game.

Loses make you a better player. Saying "Hey that's not fair. I'm never going to play the money game again". Isn't going to work.

It's not the game's fault that you sucked at playing. It's not the other players either. And it's especially not the ones that you perceive luckier than you.

It's you.

Learn, adapt, play again.
