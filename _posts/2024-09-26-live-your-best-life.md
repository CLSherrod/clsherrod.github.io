I wrote this poem to motivate a friend and thought my audience would like to read it.

## Live Your Best Life

Living your best life is up to you, and only you,
Don't compare your journey to what others do.
In the vast tapestry of life's grand array,
Find your own path, walk your own way.

Don't chase the shadows of another's flight,
Your light is unique, shining so bright.
You don't need to be the best in any game,
Just be yourself, without fear or shame.

In the mirror's gaze, see your true worth,
A being of beauty, since the day of your birth.
Your dreams and passions, your hopes and desires,
Are the fuel to light your inner fires.

Don't measure your joy by another's scale,
Your heart knows the rhythm, your soul sets the sail.
Live your best life now, in the present's embrace,
With courage and love, in your own sacred space.

For life is a gift, a precious, fleeting treasure,
Filled with moments of pain and boundless pleasure.
So dance to your tune, sing your own song,
In the symphony of existence, where you belong.

Live your best life, with all your might,
In the glow of your spirit, burning so bright.
For the only competition that truly exists,
Is becoming the best you, in this beautiful twist.
