I wrote this poem during a writing session from my book I’m currently writing about my electromagnetic hypersensitivity. It's about about my time being confined to my darkened bedroom recovering from a gran mal seziure and my time dreaming, traveling the cosmos, and the magic of imagination from my bed. 

**My Bed is a Spaceship**

My bed is a spaceship, floating through space,
A silent vessel in the starry embrace.
Drifting through galaxies, nebulae bright,
Exploring the cosmos, in the still of night.

Pillows are clouds, soft and serene,
Propelling me forward in this cosmic scene.
Blankets like stardust, shimmering, light,
Wrapping me gently in the celestial night.

The mattress, my cockpit, steady and true,
Guides me through wonders, old and new.
Planets and stars, they whisper and glow,
As I journey through realms, both high and low.

Comets streak by, leaving trails of light,
In the infinite vastness, a beautiful sight.
My bed is a spaceship, taking me far,
Beyond the horizons of the nearest star.

In dreams, I wander through the Milky Way,
Where time and space lose their sway.
Floating in silence, with endless grace,
My bed is a spaceship, in the expanse of space.

When morning arrives, with its soft, golden light,
My voyage concludes, till the next starry night.
Yet, in my heart, the journey remains,
My bed is a spaceship, through the cosmos' lanes.
