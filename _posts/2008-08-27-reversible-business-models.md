I just finished reading this excellent post. Here is a quote.
>In China, some doctors are paid monthly when you are healthy. If you are sick, it's their fault, so you don't have to pay that month. It's their goal to get you healthy and keep you healthy so they can get paid.

Shai Agassi of Better Place designed a business model for electric cars where the car is given away for free because the company makes its profit on the electricity and battery maintenance.

I see some reverse business plans as being brilliant. Some open up a new market. Ink jet printers under $100 with the ink cartridges is a new market I believe, people that that don't want to pay a lot. The existing ink jet market people go forward with their existing printers. The two markets can co-exist because they don't clash.
