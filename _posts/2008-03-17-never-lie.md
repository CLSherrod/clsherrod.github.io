One of Arnold Schwarzenegger's kids asked him if he was killing more pets in California when he was governor. He had approved a measure to reduce the number of days before killing cats and dogs in animal shelters. Animal rights groups were starting to send out press releases and make a lot of noise.

Arnold stepped up to the mic and said that the proposed money cut in the animal shelters was a mistake. The controversy was over immediately. The animal rights groups had nothing else to go after and the story was dead in a day.
