## Sharing The Law of Attraction With Your Kids and Teens

> Is Taking Action Part of the Law of Attraction Formula?

There has been so much feedback about the movie *The Secret* implying that you can wish your way into having something you want without taking action. Just visualize what you want and poofâ€ it's yours.  For me, the message of taking action is clear throughout the entire movie. This is an important distinction to understand, especially when sharing the *Law of Attraction* with our kids and teens. Most high-profile spiritual leaders (Dr. Joe Vitale, T. Harv Eker, Dr. John DeMartini, Mike Dooley, for instance) will tell you that you cannot expect to achieve your goals if you are unwilling to take action. If you want to start a business, for instance, you have to take the necessary steps.  The *Law of Attraction* does not mean that you simply picture something in your mind and you will create it. Perhaps that happens for some and if you know anyone who has reached that level of spiritual enlightenment, I'd love to interview them. I know these beings exist! But for the rest of us, we need to take the appropriate actions in the direction of our dreams.

## You Don't Have to Figure Out the How

The distinction here is that while you need to take action, you do not have to figure out the How. In other words, you don't have to figure out How your End Result is actually going to manifest. Just do what's in front of you to do. The Universe will figure out the rest. Follow your guidance. Mediate every day so you can get in touch with your Source. Then ask yourself each day, what I am guided to do today? If your teenager is starting an Internet business, for instance, she would need to decide what the product or service is going to be, do some research, get the hosting set up, choose a domain name, get the website designed and then market the website. However, like any entrepreneur, she will **not** have everything figured out. Perhaps she has no idea where she is going to get the money to hire a website designer. And that's okay. The important thing is that she gets clear about her End Resultâ€. What is her ultimate goal? What is her particular Whyâ€ behind wanting to create this business?

## Here are some examples:
- Make enough money to buy a new car
- Travel throughout Europe this summer
- Start investing in stocks and live a luxurious lifestyle
- Buy my parents a nice gift for their anniversary
- Travel to Africa with youth group to feed hungry children

Help your child or teen identify his or her End Result, take the appropriate actions and not worry about how it's all going to come together. Let the Universe work its magic!

Say your son wants to get into a certain college but his grades are low. Should he just close his eyes and visualize better grades? Yes, it will be most helpful for him to visualize, but there are also other logical, appropriate actions he needs to take.

Or perhaps your three-year old wants a new talking doll. If you wanted to take this opportunity to teach her how to attract what she wants, you could say something like this: What actions can we take to get the new doll? You could practice picturing what you want in your mind and then you could take some actions too. You could save up money in your piggy bank or ask Grandma to buy it for your birthday. Do you have any other ideas?

If I think back on how certain things have happened for me, I could not have orchestrated it better if I tried. I had no way of knowing that attending a seminar in Atlanta and meeting a person would lead me to another person which would lead me to an interview with person that would skyrocket my career.

Let's fact it. It is highly doubtful that we know *everything* there is to know about how the Universe works. So how could we possibly do a better job at planning and arranging things to our own benefit than the Universe? The point is for us to check with Spirit and ask What's next? What actions should I take?

Teach your children how to check in with spirit. And then teach them to trust the guidance they receive and follow their instincts throughout the day.

## What's the Best Way to Teach Kids The Law of Attraction?

If you want to share The Law of Attraction with your children, make your own spiritual growth your first priority. In fact, that is the most precious gift you can give to your children: a parent who is nurturing his or her own spirit.
