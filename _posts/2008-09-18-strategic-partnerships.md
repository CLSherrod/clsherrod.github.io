Are you struggling? Does it seem you are not moving forward?

Have you thought about doing strategic partnerships?

If you are running out of time to do what you want to do then partner with someone that can help. I was having this same problem and I started to partner with people. I have a ton of products coming on down the pipeline and I'm partnering on most of them.

There is always a way to get something done. It is just a matter of figuring it out...or better yet intending it.
