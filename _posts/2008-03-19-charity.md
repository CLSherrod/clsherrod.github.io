Picking a charity is actually harder than most people think.

Some look great but they spend a vast majority of what they take in on admin and marketing. Sending out all that weekly mail is expensive.

Some charities are private and you can't find out anything about them really, but the public ones you can.

Goto [Charity Navigator](https://www.charitynavigator.org/discover-charities/) and you can research them.

Look for sound fiscal management by looking at their financial metrics.
