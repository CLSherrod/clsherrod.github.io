My article about my friend dying and its impact for me has been published by Good Men Project.

As an author and publisher I love writing and journaling from my heart and daily experiences. That is where the magic happens. This article I hope will help support others and it helped me heal by writing it. I'm humble and honored that they published it.

I would apprecate reading and sharing atÂ [Good Men Project](http://goodmenproject.com/featured-content/my-friend-died-and-we-are-loved-dtv/).
