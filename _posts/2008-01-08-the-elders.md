Richard Branson along with Peter Gabriel started The Elders.  A great idea.  They are people the world trust and are free from politica, military and economic pressures.

>We are moving to a global village and yet we don't have our global elders.  The Elders could be a group who have the trust of the world, who can speak freely, be fiercely independent,  and respond fast and flexibly in conflict situations.
