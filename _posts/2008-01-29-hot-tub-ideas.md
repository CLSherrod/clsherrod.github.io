excerpt: Soaking in a hot tub generates ideas.

I'm know for being Mr. Jacuzzi.  I can sit and enjoy a good jacuzzi for hours.  I'm the first one to notify management when at a resort if the jacuzzi isn't working or too cold.  The condo we are renting right now has excellent management and the jacuzzi is very good.

So, I wanted to be able to record ideas I get in the jacuzzi as I'm in it for awhile.  My handy moleskine notebook would get wet and my digital voice recorder doesn't like water so I would just have to remember whatever I came up with so I could write it down inside.  Well, after a couple of hours of hot bubbling water and maybe a couple of drinks I have a tendency to forget.

Then I remember my scuba diving days with a Diver's slate and being able to write underwater at 50 feet. I've recorded many ideas while masterminding or brainstorming in the jacuzzi.  I then bring it back with me and the next day put it into my idea tracker system.

Some tips, it does glow in the dark and you need an eraser and pencil sharpener.

Here is to your future jacuzzi mastermind sessions.  May they be profitable and full of fun.
