## When Good Service Disappears Overnight

I used the same website hosting company for over a decade. It wasn’t flashy, but the customer service was fast, the prices were fair, and everything worked like it should. When something went wrong, a real human helped me fix it—quickly and with real technical know-how.

Then one day, I got an email. The company had been bought out by GoDaddy.

At first, not much changed. But over the next year, things slowly fell apart. The service got patchy, support got slower, and the helpful tech folks were replaced with reps who could only copy and paste answers from a FAQ. When I asked detailed questions, they couldn’t follow. They weren’t trained—they were just reading scripts.

## The Problems You Don’t See… Until It’s Too Late

Most people wouldn’t notice some of the issues that started popping up. But I ran a real, money-making website. I noticed.

For example, WooCommerce emails—those automatic order confirmations and receipts customers rely on—started going straight into spam folders. That’s a huge red flag. Turns out, a lot of email servers don’t trust anything coming off GoDaddy’s IP addresses.

And that was just the start. Page load times slowed. Security warnings popped up. Uptime wasn’t what it used to be. It became clear: the hosting company I loved didn’t exist anymore. It just had the same name on the door and then they just put the new name on the door at the very end.

## The Bigger Picture: What Happens When Profit Comes Before Service

I did some digging and found out something interesting (and troubling). A big holding company owns GoDaddy—and a bunch of other hosting providers. Their business model? Buy solid niche companies with good reputations, cut costs, cram more customers onto the same servers, and rake in the profits.

The people running this show aren’t looking out for small business owners, freelancers, or anyone who actually _depends_ on their website working right. They’re betting their customers won’t notice—or won’t know enough to do anything about it.

But if you’ve been around the block, you notice.

## My Advice: Go Small to Win Big

If you rely on your website to bring in income—even a little—you need a hosting provider that takes their job seriously. Don’t go with the cheapest option or the biggest name. Go with someone independent. Someone who still answers the phone. Someone who actually knows what they’re doing.

I eventually switched to a small, independent hosting company that specializes in WordPress performance and customer service. It cost a bit more. But now things _work_. And when I reach out, I get help from someone who knows what they’re talking about.

## The Bottom Line

You get what you pay for. When you cut corners with hosting, it can cost you a lot more than a few bucks a month—it can cost you customers, trust, and peace of mind.

Spend the extra time to choose a provider that fits your real-world needs. Your future self—and your business—will thank you.
