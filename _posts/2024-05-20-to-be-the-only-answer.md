excerpt: Poem about to be is a gift.
---
For years I would randomly say in a deep actor's theatre voice "To Be Or Not To Be. To Be!" around the house. Usual after having a nice creative session. I think it's a stupid question because for me the only answer is To Be. I can only be me. I can only be. To be is a gift that I don't want to give up. So I wrote a poem.

## To Be: The Only Answer

To be or not to be, the age-old query posed,
A question steeped in history, by many minds composed.
Yet in its tangled threads, the answer stands so clear,
To be is always chosen, the path that we revere.

To be is to exist, to breathe, to feel, to live,
To dance within the moments, to love and to forgive.
Not to be is nothingness, a void, an empty space,
A life unlived, a journey lost, a fate we don't embrace.

So why the doubt, the pondering, the endless contemplation?
When to be is to engage, to shape our own creation.
It's in the being that we find the essence of our soul,
The dreams we chase, the love we give, the stories we unroll.

To be is to face challenges, to rise above the fray,
To stand in light, to claim our might, and greet each dawning day.
It's to laugh and cry, to wonder why, to seek and to explore,
To find our place, our own true grace, and always strive for more.

So cast aside the questions, the doubts that cloud your mind,
Embrace the being, the seeing, the truth that's intertwined.
For in the choice of being, we find our truest call,
To live, to love, to be ourselves, the greatest gift of all.
