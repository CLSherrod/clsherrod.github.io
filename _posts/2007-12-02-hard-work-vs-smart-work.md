excerpt: What's better hard work or smart work.
---
I'm at the beach for the month of December.  Some of it to relax like this weekend.  Some of it to work like any other day.

I focus on working smart not hard.  I've noticed that the businesses that thrive are smart and not hard.

I don't understand why working hard is better.  I mean I work but I don't struggle at it.  I don't work myself into the ground and don't have a life.

Yet some people in my life think I should work hard.

Why?

Working hard doesn't mean you'll be more successful.  It just means you won't be as successful because you are so busy that you don't think about how to automate your business.

Businesses are money making machines that produce a product or service that people want.  Not something to keep you busy.</p>

That doesn't mean you shouldn't love what you do.  You have to love what you do.

Well, I'm off to watch a movie. Work smart not hard.Â  And enjoy life.
