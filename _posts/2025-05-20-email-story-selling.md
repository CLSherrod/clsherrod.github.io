Let me be clear: I don’t typically enjoy most email marketing books. Too long, too bloated, too obsessed with “delivering value” while delivering very little profit. But every so often, something scrappy and disruptive finds its way onto my digital desk—and Email Storyselling Playbook hit me like a lightning bolt in a sea of drizzle.

This is not just another funnel-hacking fluff piece. This is a manifesto for the misfits of marketing—the quiet experts, the coaches, the consultants—who are tired of giving away their soul in the name of “goodwill” and just want their newsletter to actually convert. And convert it will, if you follow the 4-step formula outlined with dead-simple clarity and a bit of renegade charm.

**Why is this a 5-star book?** Because it flips the sacred cow of “providing value” on its back, and serves up the content to people who are ready to implement. The author isn’t interested in pontificating. He’s done the hard thing—turned real failure into $10M+ success through email—and he shares the exact system that did it. And no, it doesn’t require a Pulitzer Prize in storytelling.

Instead, he gives you:

A deceptively simple 4-step formula that works even if writing isn’t your gift.
- The two types of stories that actually lead to sales (one of them is criminally underused).
- A swipeable template you can use or hand off to your AI muse.
- A “lazy person’s” approach to content that makes brilliance feel effortless.
- A 30-Day challenge to put it into practice *immediately*—not “someday.”

And here’s the part I love most: the author doesn’t apologize for selling. He doesn’t dress it up in service-first saccharine or spend 50 pages trying to win you over with pleasantries. He sells. With stories. And he teaches you to do the same.

**Bottom line:**
If you're burned out from the “just give value!” crowd...
If you’re done bleeding hours into free content that goes nowhere...
If you’re ready to make money with your newsletter while staying human...

Then this book is your next move. Don’t overthink it. Read it. Apply it. And stop trying to be a saint when you’re meant to be a storyteller who gets paid.

*A masterclass in simplicity, subversion, and selling with soul.*
