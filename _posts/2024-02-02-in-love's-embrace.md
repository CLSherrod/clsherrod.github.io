excerpt: A love poem about my love.
---
I found myself inspired to pen a testament to love this afternoon. This poem is not just an utterance of affection but a celebration of the journey shared with a soulmate. In a world often shadowed by uncertainties, I wanted to immortalize the unwavering love that Nan and I embody. Love isn't merely measured against the backdrop of challenges but is an indomitable force that eclipses them all. As I share this poetic proclamation, it is my hope that the essence of enduring love resonates with hearts that believe in the magic of being a team, just like us. Love, after all, is the sweetest melody in life's grand symphony. üåü‚ù§Ô∏è #LovePoetry #TeamForever

## In Love's Embrace

In the symphony of "We," where two hearts align,
My declaration echoes, a love so divine.
When I whisper, "I LOVE YOU" with ardor and zest,
It's not a measure against the love you invest.

Not a comparison of the love in your gaze,
But a vow for the future, through life's intricate maze.
I love you more than the storms we may weather,
More than the challenges we'll face together.

Our love transcends the distance that parts,
A love story etched in the beats of our hearts.
I love you more than the fights that may brew,
For in the afterglow, our love stays true.

Obstacles may rise, like shadows they flee,
Yet my love for you, an unwavering decree.
In the dance of our journey, amidst joys and strife,
I love you the most, the essence of my life.

So, let the world spin, let challenges play,
In this dance of devotion, our love holds sway.
Chris and Nan, a team, hand in hand,
In love's embrace, forever we stand.
