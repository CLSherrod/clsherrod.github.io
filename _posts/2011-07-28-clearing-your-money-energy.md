This week has been summer cleaning for me with money.

I closed an extra bank account. Got rid of a safety deposit box that I didn't need anymore.

Moved money to investments and balanced my asset allocation.

Even looked at my latest credit score.

I do this to bring me back to center. To clear my money energy so that I can optimize the amount of money I attract.

And it feels great.

I'm now again optimized and ready to go on to my next project.</

Tip:  Having real metal (gold, silver, etc) is a great base to your investments. It grounds you and make you just feel wealthy. Plus they look cool and give me the greatest wealthy vibe. Even a little will totally change your wealth vibe. Try it.
