### Additional Markdown Resources
I’ve created some markdown projects to help me organize things in my life. I hope you find them helpful.
- [One Big Text File Markdown Journal](https://christophersherrod.com/obtf/) - I keep track on what I’ve worked on in one big text file where I add the new day at the top of the file. Been doing this since January 2022. 
- [Home Manual Journal in Markdown](https://christophersherrod.com/home-manual/) - what I use to track everything in home
- [Gardening Notes in Markdown](https://christophersherrod.com/gardening/) -  how I keep track of my plants
- [Basic Contact Relationship Management System in Markdown.](https://christophersherrod.com/crm/) -  I found most contact system to be too complicated so I made a simple plaintext files to maintain contact notes
