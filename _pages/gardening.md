## Home Manual Markdown

**A simple, durable way to document, understand, and steward your home life using Markdown.**

Your home is more than a place — it’s a set of routines, tools, spaces, responsibilities, and knowledge. The Home Manual is a plain-text system that helps you _track all of that_ without complexity: maintenance schedules, appliance info, cleaning rhythms, project plans, supplies lists, and anything else that belongs to how you live under one roof.

This isn’t an app. It’s not a database. It’s a _Markdown file_ — a format that’s future-proof, open, lightweight, and under your control.

At its core, the Home Manual helps you externalize what matters about your home — not perfectly, but honestly and usefully. It belongs in the same family as your other plain-text life systems, like the _One Big Text File_ journal you might already use. ([Christopher Sherrod](https://christophersherrod.com/home-manual/ "Home Manual Markdown - Christopher Sherrod"))

## What It Is

The Home Manual is a collection of Markdown files and wiki-style links that model your home life. Instead of hiding information in scattered apps, screenshots, or memory, you keep it in a place you can search, edit, reference, and version with real tools you already own.

Markdown is simple text with light formatting: headings, lists, dates, tags, and links. It works everywhere (editors, phones, computers) and never becomes obsolete.

This makes the Home Manual both a _practical reference_ and a _living document_ of how your home actually works.

## Why a Home Manual Exists

Standard home management tools are either too rigid (checklist apps that expire), too productized (subscription-based services that disappear), or too complex (databases and templates that demand maintenance).

A plain-text system solves this by being:

- **Flexible:** You define the structure that works for you.
    
- **Accessible:** Open files you can edit anywhere, anytime.
    
- **Future-proof:** No vendor lock-in, no subscriptions.
    
- **Low-friction:** No complexity that slows you down.
    

The Home Manual isn’t about perfection. It’s about presence: _knowing what you need, when you need it, without noise._

## What You Can Track in It

A Home Manual can include:

- maintenance schedules (filters changed, check-ups due),
    
- furniture and appliance details,
    
- paint colors and finishes,
    
- cleaning routines and rhythms,
    
- utility contacts,
    
- project plans and progress notes,
    
- storage inventories and supplies lists.
    

There’s no fixed list — just what’s _useful for your life under roof._

## Who It’s For

This system works best for people who:

- want fewer tools, not more,
    
- value clarity over bureaucracy,
    
- appreciate slow, mindful stewardship of life,
    
- prefer writing practice that _documents lived experience_.
    

If your goal is to _understand_ your home rather than _manage_ it obsessively, this fits.

## How to Use It (Practical Steps)

1. **Clone or copy the repository** to your device.
    
2. Open the Home Manual Markdown folder in your editor of choice.
    
3. Use the existing files as templates for your own entries.
    
4. Add pages as needed: `Appliances.md`, `Maintenance.md`, `Projects.md`, etc.
    
5. Use wiki-style links (`[[Appliances]]`) for easy navigation.
    
6. Search with your editor when you need to find something fast.
    

There’s no governance layer, no sync algorithm to master — just your content and a text editor.

## FAQ

**Do I need special software?**  
No. Any text editor that reads Markdown will work. If you want backlinks or auto-search, choose an editor with those features built-in.

**Can this replace apps like Notion or Evernote?**  
It can replace them for many personal workflows if simplicity and longevity matter more than bells and whistles.

**Will the files get messy?**  
Only if you force them into structures you don’t actually use. Keep it practical, not perfect.

**Can I link my Home Manual with other writing systems (like OBTF)?**  
Yes — treating the manual as part of your broader ecosystem lets ideas flow between practices without fragmentation.

## Repository

The Home Manual project is here on GitHub:

It’s intentionally minimal — a skeleton of what matters, patiently waiting for your lived experience to fill it.
