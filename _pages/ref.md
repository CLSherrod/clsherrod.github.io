## Parenting With Love: How to Raise Emotionally Healthy Children by Kent Sherrod

[![Parenting With Love: How to Raise Emotionally Healthy Children](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91-3kbL9eXL._SL1500_.jpg){: .align-right style="width:250px;" }]((https://amzn.to/45jUXSO)){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Parenting With Love: How to Raise Emotionally Healthy Children"}

I wrote the foreword for my Dad's book on raising children.

A simple and powerful book on remembering the #1 thing that all kids need - Love. Inspired by his loving heart and desire to see all being in happy relationship, Kent saw how often parents project their frustrations and anger into their parenting. Seeing how damaging it is to yell, and carry that anger around, and how deeply it affects children, he wrote this inspired book to help parents remember what is important and that each little thing is nothing in comparison to the lifelong impact you have on your children.

## Expect Miracles by Joe Vitale

[![Expect Miracles](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/812TzsPoC9L._SL1500_.jpg){: .align-right style="width:250px;" }]((https://amzn.to/45jUXSO)){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Expect Miracles"}

I contributed to Joe Vitale's book on Manifesting one's dreams and wishes is not as hard we we think it is. Vitale's practical, easy to apply psychology involves attracting one's life desires by understanding and accepting them. This book enables readers to show results on their own quickly and easily. Miracles are neither impossible to experience nor difficult to achieve if we allow ourselves to make them possible.
