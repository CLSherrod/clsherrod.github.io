# About My Writing

I’ve always been someone who tries to make sense of life by putting words on the page. As a kid, I scribbled down half-formed stories and business ideas on scraps of paper. Later, after running companies, traveling the world, and even surviving health setbacks that forced me to slow down, I found myself writing not just to remember—but to understand.
## Blog Posts/Essays

My essays grew out of those moments when I wanted to capture a truth before it slipped away. They’re simple, plainspoken, and a little raw at times. I don’t dress things up. Instead, I write about what it _really_ feels like to pursue success, to wrestle with meaning, and to choose a slower, more fulfilling way of life in a world that’s always speeding up.

Readers often tell me [my blog posts](https://christophersherrod.com/blog/) feel like conversations over coffee—stories with lessons tucked inside them. That’s intentional. I want each piece to feel human, like you’re talking with someone who’s been there, not being lectured by someone who thinks they have it all figured out.

## My Book: How To Create New Business Ideas Based On What You Love

[![How To Create New Business Ideas Based On What You Love Book](/assets/images/books/How-To-Create-New-Business-Ideas.webp){: .align-right style="width:320px;" }](https://amzn.to/3oZlRrW){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="How To Create New Business Ideas Based On What You Love Book"}

This book was born out of a question I kept hearing: _How do you come up with ideas that matter?_ After running businesses that sometimes felt empty, I realized the real key wasn’t finding “the next big thing.” It was paying attention to what you love—what lights you up—and then shaping ideas around that.

The book is both a guide and a story. It’s about learning to trust your instincts, connect with your passions, and turn them into something that can stand on its own in the real world. I wrote it for anyone who’s tired of chasing someone else’s dream and wants to create their own.

## Why I Write

For me, writing isn’t just about sharing knowledge—it’s about leaving a trail. When I look back at the challenges I’ve faced—quitting a secure job, starting over, living abroad, even recovering from seizures that made me rethink everything—I see turning points. Writing lets me mark those places and say: _This is what I learned. Maybe it will help you, too._

That’s why I keep showing up to the page. Not because I have all the answers, but because I believe in asking the right questions.
## Additional Resources

If something I’ve written sparks a thought or a question, the best way to connect with me is through my newsletter. That’s where I share my latest essays, behind-the-scenes stories, and reflections I don’t post anywhere else.
