## ✍️ Short Bio

> Christopher Sherrod is the author of *Unplug: The 3-Step Plan to Heal from Hidden EMF Radiation and Reclaim Your Life* and a sacred artist devoted to the slow life. After surviving a life-altering seizure, he helps others live more intentionally in a noisy, tech-driven world.

## 📖 Long Bio

Christopher Sherrod is a writer, sacred geometry artist, and advocate for living a slower, more intentional life. After a massive seizure left him unable to function in the modern tech world, he rebuilt his health by unplugging—literally. He now teaches others how to reduce EMF exposure, reconnect with their body’s wisdom, and reclaim peace and purpose.

He’s the author of *Unplug*, a book that blends memoir and practical healing steps, and he offers a companion course and checklist. Christopher lives beachside in Mexico with his wife Nan, where they co-create retreats, books, and online courses for healing and living fully.
