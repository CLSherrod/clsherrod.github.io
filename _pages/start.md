**Hi, I’m Christopher Sherrod.**  
I’m a writer, artist, and slow lifestyle advocate. I help people unplug from toxic modern systems and reconnect with what really matters: health, truth, creativity, and joy.

This site is a living library of the lessons I’ve learned from nearly dying, letting go of a fast-paced career, and building a fulfilling life in México.

## 🧱 My Core Pillars

These are the themes I return to again and again. Click to explore:
### 🌿 **Living a Slower, More Sacred Life**

We’ve been sold a hustle myth. I believe in a different rhythm — one that honors rest, creativity, and simplicity.
