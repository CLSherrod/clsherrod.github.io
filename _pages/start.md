**Hi, I’m Christopher Sherrod.**  
I’m a writer, artist, and slow lifestyle advocate. I help people unplug from toxic modern systems and reconnect with what really matters: health, truth, creativity, and joy.

This site is a living library of the lessons I’ve learned from nearly dying, letting go of a fast-paced career, and building a fulfilling life in México.

## 🧱 My Core Pillars

These are the themes I return to again and again. Click to explore:
### 🌿 **Living a Slower, More Sacred Life**

We’ve been sold a hustle myth. I believe in a different rhythm — one that honors rest, creativity, and simplicity.

Read my essays:
- [Striving For Balance - My True Life Goals](/striving-for-balance/)
- [Finding Balance: Why Extreme Mindsets Don’t Lead to Entrepreneurial Success](/finding-balance/)
- [The Power of Letting Go: Why Not Caring What Others Think is One of Life’s Greatest Lessons](/power-of-letting-go/)

### ⚡️ **Electromagnetic Sensitivity & Modern Health**

I have had several seizures that have changed my life. Now I teach others how to reduce EMF exposure and reclaim their well-being.

- My upcoming book: [Unplug: The 3-Step Plan to Protect Your Body from Hidden EMF Radiation and Reclaim Your Health](/unplug) (Coming Soon)
- Practical guide: Reducing EMF Exposure Checklist (Coming Soon)
- And my tribute to [The Digital Canary: Arthur Firstenberg’s Legacy of Electromagnetic Awareness](/arthur-firstenberg/)

### 🐬 **Fulfilling Work & Slow Entrepreneurship**

Success doesn’t have to cost your soul. I write about doing meaningful work without burning out.

- Essay: [Forget Shark Tank; Be A Dolphin Entrepreneur Instead](/dolphin-entrepreneur/)  
- Essay: [Success is Built in Baby Steps: Why Overnight Success is a Myth](/baby-steps/)
- Book: [How To Create New Business Ideas Based On What You Love](https://amzn.to/3oZlRrW)
- Book: [Hiring Virtual Workers For Small Business](https://amzn.to/2FvAxx9)  

### 🌎 **Expat Life & Travel Reflections**

I’ve been living abroad since 2016. It’s not just about escaping — it’s about choosing better.
