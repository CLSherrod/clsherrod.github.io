Everything I make grows out of a single, ongoing practice.

I don’t separate work from life. Writing, art, books, and tools are how I think, pay attention, and stay oriented over time. None of this is built for speed, scale, or constant output. It’s built to last.

This page is a map of that work.

### Writing & Books

Writing is my primary medium.

I’ve been writing online since 2000—essays, books, and daily reflections about meaning, work, attention, and intentional living. My writing is plainspoken and experiential. I’m not interested in productivity hacks or motivational theater. I’m interested in clarity, honesty, and lived experience.

Much of this work is shared freely through essays and a daily newsletter. Some ideas take longer and become books.

### Practice & Courses

Some people prefer to read.  
Others want a little structure.

Alongside my writing, I create calm, self-paced courses and guided practices. These aren’t programs to “fix” yourself or systems to optimize your life. They’re ways of slowing down, clarifying direction, and practicing what actually matters—daily, in real life.

The **Living a Fulfilling Life Course** is the quiet core behind this work.

### Visual Art

Some experiences can’t be reached through language.

My visual art explores sacred geometry, pattern, rhythm, and perception. The work is quiet and meditative—designed to be experienced rather than explained. It’s another way of paying attention, without words.

### Tools & Systems (Plain Text)

I prefer tools that are simple enough to understand, flexible enough to adapt, and durable enough to last for decades.

Over the years, I’ve developed a small set of plain-text systems using Markdown and basic files. These aren’t productivity products or apps. They’re working systems I use myself—shared openly for anyone who prefers clarity over complexity.

They reflect the same values as the rest of my work: low cognitive load, long-term thinking, and tools that get out of the way.

**Markdown-based systems I actively use and maintain:**

- **OBTF (One Big Text File)**  
    A minimalist journaling system built around a single evolving Markdown file.

- **Home Manual (Markdown)**  
    A plain-text way to document everything about a home—systems, notes, and history.  
    → [https://christophersherrod.com/home-manual/](https://christophersherrod.com/home-manual/)
    
- **CRM (Markdown)**  
    A lightweight relationship-tracking system without software bloat.  
    → [https://christophersherrod.com/crm/](https://christophersherrod.com/crm/)
    
- **Gardening (Markdown)**  
    A low-tech method for tracking planting, seasons, and observations over time.

These systems aren’t meant to scale.  
They’re meant to be lived with.

### Long-Running Work

Some work doesn’t fit neatly into categories.

Since 1999, I’ve run **Who Defines You**, a small, referral-only web practice that grew out of early internet consulting. It’s intentionally quiet and relationship-based, focused on doing good work for people I trust.

This body of work wasn’t designed to impress.  
It was designed to be livable.

If something here resonates, you’re welcome to explore further—or join the daily newsletter, where this practice continues in small, ongoing notes.
