In 2018, a massive seizure brought my world to a screeching halt. Overexposure to electronics pushed my body and mind to the brink, leaving me clinging to life and facing a long, grueling recovery. This is my story — a journey of rediscovery, resilience, and hope.  

In *Unplug*, I share my deeply personal experience of battling sensitivity to electronic devices, the lessons I learned along the way, and how I reclaimed my health and happiness by transforming my lifestyle. This book is more than a memoir—it's a guide for anyone feeling the weight of technology on their body and soul.  

## You’ll discover:  
- **The hidden dangers of our tech-saturated lives** and the surprising ways electronics can affect your health.  
- **Practical tips to minimize exposure** to harmful electronic frequencies while staying connected in a modern world.  
- **Holistic strategies for living healthier and more intentionally**, from mindfulness practices to creating tech-free spaces.  
- **Insights into living a regret-free life** and embracing peace, purpose, and the inevitability of death.  

Packed with practical advice, scientific insights, and inspiration, *Unplugged* is a must-read for anyone seeking a healthier, more balanced relationship with technology—and with life itself.  

**Rediscover the joy of living lightly. Let go of the noise, and find your quiet path.**
