[OBTF (One Big Text File) Journal - GitHub](https://github.com/CLSherrod/OBTF) is a simple yet powerful solution for maintaining a journal in Markdown or plain text format. Unlike traditional daily note files, OBTF Journal consolidates all entries into a single text file, with each new day appended to the top of the existing file.
