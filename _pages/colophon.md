## What Is a Colophon?

A colophon is a note traditionally placed at the end of a book that describes how it was made — the tools used, the design choices, and the thinking behind it.

This page serves the same purpose for this website.

It’s a simple record of how this site is built, why it exists, and the principles guiding its creation.

## About This Site

ChristopherSherrod.com is written and maintained by Christopher Sherrod.

This site is intentionally simple.

I value **clarity over complexity**, **substance over noise**, and **writing that lasts longer than trends**. Everything here is designed to load quickly, read easily, and stay out of the way of the ideas.

There are no ads, no trackers, and no invasive analytics.

I care about attention, privacy, and building things that don’t ask more from you than they give back.

The goal isn’t growth for its own sake — it’s usefulness, calm, and longevity.

If something on this site doesn’t work well for you, I genuinely want to know.

## Philosophy of This Site

This site is built around a simple belief:

**The internet doesn’t need to be louder to be better.**

It doesn’t need infinite scrolling, dark patterns, or constant updates.  
It needs places that feel grounded, readable, and human.

That’s what I’m aiming for here.
- Fewer distractions
- Clear writing
- Pages that load fast and age well
- Ideas that respect your time and attention

This site is intentionally small.  
It’s not optimized for clicks, growth hacks, or engagement metrics.

If you’re reading this years from now, I hope it still feels calm.
## Writing Process

Most of the writing on this site follows a simple flow:
- Long-form drafts written in **Obsidian**
- Edited in plain text
- Minimal formatting
- Intentional pacing and spacing
  
The goal is clarity, not volume.
## Essential Content-Creation Tools

I keep my toolset intentionally small.
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) — writing and knowledge management
- [Zed](https://zed.dev/) — code and site maintenance
- [Eagle](https://en.eagle.cool/) — image organization and WebP exports
    
Speed, simplicity, and low distraction guide every choice.
## Typography

This site uses two typefaces from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/):
- [Archivo Narrow](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Archivo+Narrow) for headings
- [Newsreader](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Newsreader) for body text
    
Both are designed for long-form reading and quiet clarity — which suits the purpose of this site.
## Technical Details

This site is built using:
- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) — static site generator
- [Minimal Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) — theme foundation
- [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) — DNS and performance
- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) — hosting
    
The site is intentionally lightweight, fast, and easy to maintain.
