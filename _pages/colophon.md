## What is a Colophon?
An inscription placed usually at the end of a book, giving facts about its publication. In this case a page for this website.

## About This Site
ChristopherSherrod.com is written by Christopher Sherrod.

## Essential Content Creating Apps
I use [Obsidian](http://obsidian.md/) to write and [Zed](https://zed.dev) for website code project management.

I also use [Eagle](https://en.eagle.cool) to export graphics to webp format to keep the website page speed really fast.
## Typographical
This website uses two main fonts from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com).
- [Archivo Narrow](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Archivo+Narrow?query=Archivo+Narrow) for headers
- [Newsreader](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Newsreader?query=Newsreader) for everything else

I like that they are made for reading and since this website is for showing off my writing I think it's appropriate.

## Technical
This website is a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) static generated site with the [Minimal Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) theme. I use [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com) to manage all the DNS rules and it's hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).
