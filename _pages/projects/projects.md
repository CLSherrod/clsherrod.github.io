## Writing & Books

I’ve been writing online since 2000—essays, books, and notes about work, meaning, and living a fulfilling life.

- **How to Create New Business Ideas Based on What You Love**
  A practical book about building work that fits who you actually are.

- **Living a Fulfilling Life Course**
  A quiet, self-paced course built from the same ideas I write about.

## Plain-Text/Markdown Projects

I prefer simple tools that age well. These projects reflect that preference.

They’re not products. They’re working systems I use myself.

- **OBTF (One Big Text File)**
  A plain-text journaling system using Markdown.

- **Home Manual (Markdown)**
  A way to document everything about your home using simple files.

- **CRM (Markdown)**
  Relationship tracking without software bloat.
  → [https://christophersherrod.com/crm/](https://christophersherrod.com/crm/)

- **Gardening (Markdown)**
  A low-tech way to track planting, seasons, and observations.

## Creative Work

- **Chr1stopher**
  My visual art practice, exploring perception, pattern, and inner stillness.

## Work & Consulting

- **Who Defines You** (1999–present)
  A referral-only web agency that grew out of early internet consulting.
  Quiet work. Long relationships. No growth games.
