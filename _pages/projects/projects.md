My projects besides writing.

## Plain-Text/Markdown Projects

I prefer simple tools that age well. These projects reflect that preference.

They’re not products. They’re working systems I use myself.

- **OBTF (One Big Text File)**
  A plain-text journaling system using Markdown.

- **Home Manual (Markdown)**
  A way to document everything about your home using simple files.

- **CRM (Markdown)**
  Relationship tracking without software bloat.

  A low-tech way to track planting, seasons, and observations.

## Work & Consulting

- **Who Defines You** (1999–present)
  A referral-only web agency that grew out of early internet consulting.
