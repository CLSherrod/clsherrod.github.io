## CRM in Markdown

**A simple, plain-text system for tracking relationships — without apps, dashboards, or complexity.**

Most contact managers and CRMs (Customer Relationship Managers) are built for businesses trying to scale sales or automate pipelines. But what if you just want to **remember the people you care about**, keep track of your conversations, and show up more thoughtfully — without paying for software you don’t need?

CRM in Markdown is a lightweight, human-centered way to do exactly that.

It’s a set of plain-text Markdown files where you keep names, notes, reminders, and histories of interactions — all searchable, editable, and future-proof.

## Why Plain-Text CRM Works

Apps often lure you with features but demand lock-in, subscriptions, and interface training. The cost of complexity is distraction.

A Markdown CRM flips that:

You own every byte of your data.  
You decide the structure.  
You write first, organize later.  
Everything stays portable and simple.

Markdown works everywhere — phones, laptops, text editors you already know. No license, no gates.

For people who care more about _presence with others_ than _chasing productivity stats_, this approach fits gracefully.


## What Goes in a Markdown CRM

Each person gets a file or a section in a file where you record:

• names and basic info  
• contact details and preferred channels  
• context: how you met, shared interests  
• interaction history (dates + notes)  
• follow-ups and future reminders  
• reflections on conversations

The point isn’t to gamify relationships — it’s to **remember what matters**.


## How to Use It

Create a folder for your CRM notes.

Inside, you can organize files however you want:

`Contacts.md`  
or  
`Alice-Smith.md`, `Ben-Lopez.md`, etc.

A simple record might look like:

```
# Alice Smith  
first met: 2025-04-12  
met at: Writers’ Meetup  
notes: loves poetry, asks great questions  
follow-up: send reading list end of week
```

Search your folder when you want to find someone or recall what you talked about. Wiki links (`[[Alice Smith]]`) help you connect related notes.

No menus, no hidden fields — just plain text.


## CRM and Slow, Intentional Life

This isn’t about “networking to win.” This is about **cultivating awareness of the people in your life**.

The Markdown CRM supports:

being thoughtful rather than transactional,  
remembering context instead of facts alone,  
and showing up with presence instead of obligation.

In a culture obsessed with metrics, this is a gentle counterweight.

## FAQ

**Do I need special software?**  
No. Any Markdown-capable text editor works. The simpler, the better.

**Can I sync this across devices?**  
Yes — if you choose to use cloud sync or Git. Sync is optional.

**How is this different from an app CRM?**  
This system _respects your data and attention_. It doesn’t push features you don’t need.

**Won’t this get messy with many contacts?**  
Not if you keep it simple and searchable. Plain text scales fine when structure follows use, not theory.

**Can this integrate with other Markdown systems on my site?**  
Yes — your contact notes can link to your Home Manual, Projects, or One Big Text File journal. Everything stays in your plain-text ecosystem.
