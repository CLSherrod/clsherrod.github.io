**A plain-text garden journal that grows with you.**

Gardening Markdown is a lightweight, durable system for keeping notes about your garden, written in simple Markdown files. Instead of wrestling with apps that lock your data or demand constant clicks, this project lets gardeners keep _clear, searchable records_ of their soil, seeds, weather, harvests, successes, failures, and reflections — all in plain text that will last as long as your garden does.

This isn’t a tracker with bells and badges. This is a **garden memoir**, built slowly and honestly over time.

## Why Gardening Markdown

Most digital gardening tools promise convenience but come with hidden costs: locked data, subscription walls, feature bloat, and interfaces that interrupt your thinking.

Markdown solves all that:

You own the files.  
You control the structure.  
You can edit them anywhere.  
They never become obsolete.

Just as a garden rewards slow, consistent attention, this system rewards observation and reflection. When you look back at your notes months or years later, you’ll see patterns you’d otherwise forget.

## What You Can Track

With Gardening Markdown, you can record:

• Seed and transplant dates  
• Germination observations  
• Soil mixes and amendments  
• First bloom and harvest dates  
• Pests, diseases, and management strategies  
• Seasonal weather notes  
• Harvest yields and quality  
• Lessons learned and future ideas

Each file becomes a snapshot of a season, a plant, or a particular part of your gardening life.

## How It Works

Create a folder on your device for all your garden notes. Within it, use Markdown files (simple `.md` text files) to capture entries. Here are some example file structures:

`Spring-2026.md` – seasonal notes  
`Tomatoes.md` – plant-specific log  
`Soil-Mixes.md` – recipes and experiments  
`Harvests.md` – yields and results

Inside each file, use headings and lists to organize content, and link between files with wiki-style links (`[[Tomatoes]]`) to connect ideas and entries. Search your folder when you need to find something; no menus, filters, or categories to learn.

The result is a garden record that’s as malleable as soil and as open as a field.

## Gardening as Practice

This project rises from the same philosophy that guides slow living and mindful practice: **presence over performance.**

Gardening Markdown isn’t about optimizing every square inch of your plot or chasing metrics. It’s about showing up, noticing, and gently documenting what happens.

A journal like this turns gardening into a conversation with time and place, not a checklist to complete.

## FAQ

**Do I need special tools?**  
No. Any text editor that supports Markdown will work. The simpler the tool, the less friction you have.

**Can I access my notes on my phone?**  
Yes. Markdown works on phones, tablets, and computers. Sync your folder if you want access everywhere.

**What’s the advantage over a notebook?**  
Markdown combines the permanence of paper with the searchability and portability of digital text — without locking you into software.

**Will this system still work years from now?**  
Plain text is one of the most future-proof formats there is. Your notes will be readable long after any specific app is forgotten.
