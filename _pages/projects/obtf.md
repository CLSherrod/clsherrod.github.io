**A simple, durable way to think, write, and remember — without apps, dashboards, or digital clutter.**

[One Big Text File (OBTF) on GitHub](https://github.com/CLSherrod/OBTF/) is exactly what it sounds like:  
a single plain-text file where everything goes.

Notes.  
Journal entries.  
Ideas.  
Fragments.  
Lists.  
Thoughts that don’t yet know what they are.

No folders. No complex systems. Just writing.

This approach has been around for decades, quietly used by programmers, writers, and people who care more about _thinking clearly_ than _optimizing workflows_.

## Why One Big Text File Works

Most digital note systems fail for the same reason:  
they require you to decide _what something is_ before you’ve finished thinking it.

OBTF removes that friction.

You don’t categorize.  
You don’t organize.  
You don’t interrupt your thinking.

You just write.

Search later. Patterns emerge later. Meaning shows up on its own timetable.

Plain text is future-proof. It opens everywhere. It survives software trends. It doesn’t demand attention.

That’s not a limitation. That’s the design.

## What Goes Into an OBTF?

Anything that crosses your mind.

A paragraph you might use someday.  
A daily log.  
A half-formed question.  
A quote.  
A reminder to yourself.  
An idea you don’t trust yet.

If it matters enough to write down, it belongs there.

Chronological order does the work for you.

## How to Use One Big Text File

Create a single `.txt` or `.md` file.

At the top, put today’s date.  
Write underneath it.  
Tomorrow, add a new date.  
Keep going.

That’s the whole system.

When you need something, you search the file.

No maintenance.  
No migration anxiety.  
No decision fatigue.

## OBTF, Slow Living, and Writing Practice

One Big Text File pairs naturally with **slow living** and **daily writing** because it removes urgency, performance, and optimization from the process.

There is no pressure to be productive.  
No requirement to “process” your notes.  
No expectation that everything turns into output.

You show up.  
You write a little.  
You move on with your day.

Over time, the file becomes a quiet record of your thinking life — not curated, not polished, but honest. For writers, this lowers resistance. For thinkers, it preserves nuance. For anyone trying to live more deliberately, it replaces digital noise with continuity.

OBTF is not about efficiency.  
It’s about _presence_.

## FAQ

**Is One Big Text File really enough?**  
Yes. For most people, it’s more than enough. Complexity usually creates avoidance, not clarity.

**Won’t the file get too big?**  
Eventually, yes — and that’s fine. Plain-text files can handle massive amounts of content, and search is instant.

**What about organizing later?**  
If something needs to become an essay, project, or book, you can copy it out. The OBTF stays untouched.

**Is this better than apps like Notion, Obsidian, or Evernote?**  
It’s not “better.” It’s calmer. If you value durability, simplicity, and low cognitive load, OBTF wins.

**What editor should I use?**  
Any text editor you like. Notes apps that store plain text work too. The tool matters far less than the habit.

My own lightweight OBTF project lives here:

It’s intentionally minimal — meant to support writing and thinking, not manage your life.

This page exists as a quiet pointer — and a reminder that sometimes the best system is the one that asks the least of you.

Write more.  
Decide less.  
Keep it simple.
