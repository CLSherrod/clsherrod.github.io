We’ve been building on the web since the early days—always with a focus on creative solutions, practical systems, and long-term results. Our work has evolved alongside the internet itself:

* **1996** – Created my own HTML website & specialty Windows & Mac application
* **1999** – Opened up to referred clients for web development
* **2006** - [Who Defines You website launched](https://christophersherrod.com/who-defines-you-launched/)
* **2007** – WordPress development (before its public release)
* **2015** – [Won a Publishing Award](/publishing-award/)
* **2018** – WooCommerce shop setup & maintenance
* **2022** – Custom art design added to our services
* **2023** – Offering advanced static web framework development
* **2024** – Ethical AI Workflows
## Why Only Referrals?

I don’t chase clients—I focus on relationships.

My agency is built on trust, not cold calls. Every project comes to us through personal recommendations, which means we start with a foundation of mutual respect. This keeps our focus where it belongs: creating outstanding work for people who value what we do.

By avoiding the endless sales cycle, we spend our time where it matters—on results. Our reputation speaks for itself, carried forward by the clients who’ve already experienced the quality of our work.

That’s why we stay referral-only: because the right clients don’t need convincing.
