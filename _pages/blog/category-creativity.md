Writing has been the throughline of my life.

Not as a career strategy — but as a way of thinking, noticing, and making sense of the world.

This section is about creativity as a _practice_, not a performance.

## What You’ll Find Here

- Writing as thinking
- Systems that reduce friction
- Creative habits that actually stick
- Notes, notebooks, and long-form thinking
- The quiet discipline behind creative work

I’m less interested in “being creative” and more interested in **creating conditions where good thinking can happen**.

This section isn’t about publishing faster.

It’s about thinking better.

And that tends to last longer.
