**Hi, I’m Christopher Sherrod.**
I’m a writer, artist, and fulfilling lifestyle advocate. I help people unplug from toxic modern systems and reconnect with what really matters: health, truth, creativity, and joy.

This site is a living library of the lessons I’ve learned from nearly dying, letting go of a fast-paced career, and building a fulfilling life.
