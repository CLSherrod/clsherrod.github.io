I’ve been building businesses since I was a kid.

Some worked.
Some failed.
A few taught me lessons I’m still unpacking decades later.

This section isn’t about hype, funnels, or chasing trends. It’s about **doing work that makes sense**, staying independent, and building things that don’t quietly destroy your life in the process.

## Start Here

These give you the clearest sense of how I think about work:

- [Skipping Success: The Allure of Entrepreneurial Fame](/skipping-success/)
- [Finding Balance: Why Extreme Mindsets Don’t Work](/finding-balance/)

## What This Section Is Really About

- Sustainable work, not burnout
- Independence over scale
- Long-term thinking
- Honest conversations about money
- Avoiding the traps of modern entrepreneurship

I’ve run companies, consulted, built products, and watched trends come and go.
This section is what remains after the noise fades.
