## Writing
I love writing. I try to write everyday in the morning. When I write I feel fulfilled.

## Reading
I love to read, mostly books but also love reading blogs via RSS since it was invented in 2009.

## Music
I’m a huge music fan. Love a lot of different styles of music. I have even created some music.
### Musician
I post my music on my artist site [chr1stopher](https://chr1stopher.com).

### Music Fan
I listen to hours of music a day. I love Jazz and Progressive Rock a lot and Ambient and LoFi when I'm chillin'.

## Slow Health
I’m doing [Spring Forest Qi Gong](https://www.springforestqigong.com). As I’ve gotten older I really appreciate the slowness and gentle movements.

## Language Learning
I’m also learning Spanish by practicing it.

## Photography
I love photography. I even got a minor in it in college. I sold a single photo to a newspaper once and been shown in an art gallery once. I never was a professional beyond. I has been a great skill to have learned as a kid as my daily snapshots I share with family and friends are very good.

## Sci-fi
I love a good thought provoking scifi movie or series. Not the horror ones, but the classic 50s thought experiments style.  A good Star Trek over anything Star Wars.

## Enjoying My Cats
We have two cats. One in our living area and another in my writer's casita.
