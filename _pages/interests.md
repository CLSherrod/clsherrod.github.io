## Writing
I love writing. I try to write everyday in the morning. When I write I feel fulfilled.

## Reading
I love to read, mostly books but also love reading blogs via RSS since it was invented in 2009.

## Music
I’m a huge music fan. Love a lot of different styles of music. I have even created some music.
### Musician
I post my music on my artist site [chr1stopher](https://chr1stopher.com).

### Music Fan
I listen to hours of music a day. I love Jazz and Progressive Rock a lot and Ambient and LoFi when I'm chillin'.

## Slow Health
I’m doing [Spring Forest Qi Gong](https://www.springforestqigong.com). As I’ve gotten older I really appreciate the slowness and gentle movements.

## Language Learning
I’m also learning Spanish by practicing it.

## Photography
I love photography. I even got a minor in it in college. I sold a single photo to a newspaper once and been shown in an art gallery once. I never was a professional beyond. I has been a great skill to have learned as a kid as my daily snapshots I share with family and friends are very good.

## Sci-fi
I love a good thought provoking scifi movie or series. Not the horror ones, but the classic 50s thought experiments style.  A good Star Trek over anything Star Wars.

- Currently watching [Dark Matter](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt19231492/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) - fun sci-fi
- Truly weird sc-fi planet on [Scavengers Reign](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt21056886/?ref_=hm_rvi_tt_i_3) made it very different from most sci-fi out there. The animation led to making the truly weird and foreign plants and animals.
- Enjoyed Season 3 of [Resident Alien](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8690918/episodes/?season=3)
- I found the moral questions and sci-fi comedy of [Uploads Season 3](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7826376/episodes/?season=3) to be fun.
- I really liked [3 Body Problem](https://www.netflix.com/search?q=3%20body%20problem&jbv=81024821) on Netflix. I watched the Chinese 30 episode show last year which was excellent. The English remake makes it more accessible with a faster pace and even better effects.

### Enjoying My Cats
It’s been over a year since three stray cats crawled over our wall into our compound. One was adopted out and the mother and daughter became part of the family. We were told they were unadopted because they were both a bit wild but now they are great at couch cuddling and playing.
