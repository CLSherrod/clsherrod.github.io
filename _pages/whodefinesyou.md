title: Who Defines You – A Referral-Only Web Agency
permalink: /whodefinesyou/
---
We’ve been building on the web since the early days—always with a focus on creative solutions, practical systems, and long-term results. Our work has evolved alongside the internet itself:

* **1999** – HTML & PHPNuke web development
* **2007** – WordPress development (before its public release)
* **2015** – [Won a Publishing Award](/publishing-award/)
* **2018** – WooCommerce shop setup & maintenance
* **2022** – Custom art design added to our services
* **2023** – Static web framework development

## Why Only Referrals?

We don’t chase clients—we build relationships.

Our agency is built on trust, not cold calls. Every project comes to us through personal recommendations, which means we start with a foundation of mutual respect. This keeps our focus where it belongs: creating outstanding work for people who value what we do.

By avoiding the endless sales cycle, we spend our time where it matters—on design, development, and results. Our reputation speaks for itself, carried forward by the clients who’ve already experienced the quality of our work.

That’s why we stay referral-only: because the right clients don’t need convincing.
