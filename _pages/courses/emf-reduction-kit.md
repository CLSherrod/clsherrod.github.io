## Coming Soon
You don’t need expensive gadgets or fear tactics to live well in the modern world.  
You just need a clear plan — and a calmer relationship with your devices.

I created the _EMF-Free Home Starter Kit_ to help you reduce exposure, sleep deeper, and feel grounded again — without adding more tech or stress to your life.

## My Story
A few years ago, I hit a wall.  

The constant hum of electronics — Wi-Fi, phones, screens — left me exhausted and anxious.  
I thought something was wrong with me, but it turned out my environment was the problem.

When I finally unplugged, simplified, and rebuilt my space with awareness, everything changed.  
My sleep improved, my focus returned, and I started to feel human again.

This kit is what I wish I’d had back then — a calm, straightforward way to make your home a sanctuary again.

## 🌞 What’s Inside

**Five beautifully designed PDFs** to guide you room-by-room, step-by-step:

1. **The EMF-Free Home Map** — a visual guide to every common radiation source in your home and what to do about it.
2. **The 7-Day Detox Plan** — one small daily action to reduce EMFs and increase peace of mind.
3. **The Bedroom Detox Blueprint** — how to create a truly restful space and wake up refreshed.
4. **The Device Distance Guide** — the clear “how close is too close” chart you’ll wish you had years ago.
5. **The Reflection Journal** — printable pages to track your progress and reconnect with what _feels_ right again.

Everything is laid out simply, with calm visuals, white space, and practical steps you can start today.

## ✨ What You’ll Experience

✅ Less stress and fewer symptoms from constant tech exposure.  
✅ A calmer, clearer home environment.  
✅ Better sleep, steadier energy, and improved focus.  
✅ Confidence that you’re actually doing something real — not chasing gimmicks.

No jargon. No fear. Just practical wisdom from someone who’s been there.
