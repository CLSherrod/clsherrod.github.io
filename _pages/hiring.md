I wrote this book to share my hiring process that I’ve developed since 2000 when I hired my first assistant. 

I will walk you through my step-by-step process to finding a virtual worker that fits you. I believe your first helper is a virtual assistant followed by an accountant soon afterward. These two hires will impact your business directly and quickly and will pay for themselves very quickly.

> “An extremely helpful, quick guide - For years I have wondered about the best way to hire virtual assistants (VAs). This book lays it out in a helpful and systematic way. The websites included and the evaluations of each totally de-mystify the process and make it possible for you to up level your business without having to learn a bunch of technology or other distracting things. The book is a quick read and instantly helpful in running your business.” ~ David Chaumette
