## My Entrepreneurial Journey: From Software to Business Ownership to Writer
Hey there, I’m just a regular guy who’s been around the block in the business world. I’ve dabbled in everything from software to real estate, and even had my own marketing agency with teams scattered across the globe in places like the Philippines, Ireland, Panama, and India. Been cruising the internet since my college days back in ‘88, and yeah, I jumped on the WordPress train way back when it was still in beta.

These days, I’m all about newsletter-driven educational businesses. Ever since I ditched the corporate world in ‘96 to pursue entrepreneurship full-time, I’ve racked up my fair share of wins and losses. And you know what? I’ve learned a ton from both.

Now, I’m paying it forward by sharing my experiences through my business books and articles. My mentors helped me figure out the biz game, so now it’s my turn to pass on the knowledge.

## My Business Approach: The Dolphin Entrepreneur
I’ve penned down my business philosophy, dubbed the [Dolphin Entrepreneur](https://socapglobal.com/2017/08/forget-shark-tank-dolphin-entrepreneur-instead/), which you can check out in Social Capital Markets (formerly Conscious Company Magazine).

## Writing About Business
Being in the game for the long haul, I enjoy sharing my business insights through my [my articles here](https://christophersherrod.com/archive/). You can catch ‘em all right here on my site.

## Books I’ve Written
I’ve also authored a couple of business books:
- [How To Create New Business Ideas Based On What You Love](https://amzn.to/3oZlRrW)
> “This is a fascinating tool for brainstorming.  Creative ideas, concepts and exploration.” ~ Henry Novak
 
> There are also practical tips to check out the viability of your idea before taking that leap of faith. I think this would be fun to do with my teenage grandson and some of his friends as well. Planting some entrepreneurial seeds at a young age has got to be a good thing. Thanks Chris!” ~ Shelley J.W.

> ”It lives up to its title! - The prosperity games in the book really helped me and my friends generate great ideas I probably would not have thought up on my own. I highly recommend it to anyone looking to create new business ideas.” ~ Paurie

- [Hiring Virtual Workers For Small Business](https://amzn.to/2FvAxx9)
> “An extremely helpful, quick guide - For years I have wondered about the best way to hire virtual assistants (VAs). This book lays it out in a helpful and systematic way. The websites included and the evaluations of each totally de-mystify the process and make it possible for you to up level your business without having to learn a bunch of technology or other distracting things. The book is a quick read and instantly helpful in running your business.” ~ David Chaumette
