## My Entrepreneurial Journey: From Software to Business Ownership to Writer
Hey there, I’m just a regular guy who’s been around the block in the business world. I’ve dabbled in everything from software to real estate, and even had my own marketing agency with teams scattered across the globe in places like the Philippines, Ireland, Panama, and India. Been cruising the internet since my college days back in ‘88, and yeah, I jumped on the WordPress train way back when it was still in beta.

These days, I’m all about newsletter-driven educational businesses. Ever since I ditched the corporate world in ‘96 to pursue entrepreneurship full-time, I’ve racked up my fair share of wins and losses. And you know what? I’ve learned a ton from both.

Now, I’m paying it forward by sharing my experiences through my business books and articles. My mentors helped me figure out the biz game, so now it’s my turn to pass on the knowledge.

## My Business Approach: The Dolphin Entrepreneur
I’ve penned down my business philosophy, dubbed the [Dolphin Entrepreneur](https://socapglobal.com/2017/08/forget-shark-tank-dolphin-entrepreneur-instead/), which you can check out in Social Capital Markets (formerly Conscious Company Magazine).

## Writing About Business
Being in the game for the long haul, I enjoy sharing my business insights through my [my articles here](https://christophersherrod.com/archive/). You can catch ‘em all right here on my site.

## Books I’ve Written
I’ve also authored a couple of business books:
- [How To Create New Business Ideas Based On What You Love](https://amzn.to/3oZlRrW)
> “This is a fascinating tool for brainstorming.  Creative ideas, concepts and exploration.” - Henry Novak
 
> “Prosperity Games - Did you think finding your next business idea could be playful, fun and intuitive? Read this book. - What is a Prosperity Game?
> 
> It is an incredible and simple way to expand what is possible in your life - and which brings the best parts of your skills and natural ability - and helps you to possibly discover ideas which make money.
> 
> The style of the author is like talking to a friend. If you can keep in mind that you are having a conversation with a person who really wants you to succeed through your natural abilities - then you will love this book.
> 
> Perhaps the most interesting part of this book is that there are exercises called “Prosperity Games” which help you to expand what you think is possible in terms of ideas that could lead to wealth. Some of these games will feel more natural to you than others, but I would recommend trying them all out.
> 
> The reason is that some games which are unfamiliar to you, or feel strange, might cause you to think differently - which is something the author points out we need to do.
> 
> I also like that there are suggestions that are not related to business. I do believe that Traveling, and being more open in how we talk to our friends, in fact just improving how we listen can lead to tremendous prosperity.
> 
> The book gave me one or two really helpful ideas, introduced me to some great references, and is something I can come back to over time and try out the Prosperity Games whenever I feel stuck.
> 
> If you do buy the book - read the full thing, relax, and follow the exercises all the way through.”

> “Fun, Fast and Effective - A little book with a lot of valuable information, tools and YES great games to shift your mindset, amp up your creativity and get going on a new idea for fun or profit. This is an easy read which I liked as with any game we want to get past the instructions and on to the game. However, the techniques discussed and references given to go much deeper in expanding your creativity and breaking down any barriers you might have to your own prosperity or confidence are worthy of more time and exploration. I have used many of them with great results.
> 
> On to the games. They are fun and simple and can be done on your own or in a group. I did one a few months back and it gave me some new ideas and is definitely worth repeating. I plan on having some friends over to play some of the other games and we each can get feedback from the group.
> 
> There are also practical tips to check out the viability of your idea before taking that leap of faith. I think this would be fun to do with my teenage grandson and some of his friends as well. Planting some entrepreneurial seeds at a young age has got to be a good thing.
> Thanks Chris!” ~ 	Shelley J.W.

> ”It lives up to its title! - The prosperity games in the book really helped me and my friends generate great ideas I probably would not have thought up on my own. I highly recommend it to anyone looking to create new business ideas.” ~ Paurie

- [Hiring Virtual Workers For Small Business](https://amzn.to/2FvAxx9)
> “An extremely helpful, quick guide - For years I have wondered about the best way to hire virtual assistants (VAs). This book lays it out in a helpful and systematic way. The websites included and the evaluations of each totally de-mystify the process and make it possible for you to up level your business without having to learn a bunch of technology or other distracting things. The book is a quick read and instantly helpful in running your business.” ~ David Chaumette
