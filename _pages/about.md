## Practical Wisdom for a Life of Fulfillment  
Success isn’t just about business—it’s about creating a life that feels truly fulfilling. I'm a web agency owner and long-time self-help blogger. I share practical wisdom on personal growth, intentional living, and sustainable success. With decades of real-world experience, I help people design lives that align with their true purpose.  

> **“Success isn’t about working harder—it’s about aligning your life with what truly matters.”**  

### A Journey from Business to Personal Growth  
I built a successful business but realised that financial success alone wasn’t enough. Burned out and searching for meaning, I shifted my focus to designing a life based on purpose, creativity, and freedom. Now, I write about the lessons I've learned—helping others find their own path to fulfilment.  

My journey began early—starting my first business in elementary school and later leaving a corporate job at American Express to run a software company full-time. While my businesses thrived, I discovered that true success isn’t just about numbers; it’s about creating a lifestyle that supports happiness, health, and personal growth.  

I have been on the Internet since 1987 and created my first website in 1995, embracing the digital world long before it became mainstream.  

#### Lessons from Experience & Mentorship  
My biggest influences have been spiritual teachers and two entrepreneurial mentors who taught me the importance of listening—to life, to business, and to the natural flow of success. I believes that fulfilment isn’t about working harder but about working with awareness, purpose, and alignment.  

#### My Business Approach: The Dolphin Entrepreneur
I penned down my business philosophy, dubbed the [Dolphin Entrepreneur](/dolphin-entrepreneur/), which you can check out in Social Capital Markets (formerly Conscious Company Magazine).

## Writing  
My book, [How To Create New Business Ideas Based On What You Love](/book/business-ideas/), provide practical guidance for those seeking to build a business that supports their ideal lifestyle.  

Beyond clients, courses, books and making art, I share insights through [blog post essays](/blog), and [poetry](/categories/#poems) offering real-world lessons on self-improvement, lifestyle design, and the mindset shifts needed for true success.
