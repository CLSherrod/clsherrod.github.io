## Watched
- Looking forwarded to watching [Dune: Prophecy (TV Series 2024– ) - Season 1 - IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10466872/episodes/?ref_=tt_ov_epl) 
- Interesting movie [Wonderland](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt31254554/?ref_=rt_t_6)
- Fun [Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11389872/?ref_=rt_t_10)
- Good, but not a huge fan of [Dune: Part Two](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15239678/?ref_=rt_t_22)
- Enjoyed [Dark Matter](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt19231492/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) - fun sci-fi
- Truly weird sc-fi planet on [Scavengers Reign](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt21056886/?ref_=hm_rvi_tt_i_3) made it very different from most sci-fi out there. The animation led to making the truly weird and foreign plants and animals.
- Enjoyed Season 3 of [Resident Alien](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8690918/episodes/?season=3)
- I found the moral questions and sci-fi comedy of [Uploads Season 3](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7826376/episodes/?season=3) to be fun.
- I really liked [3 Body Problem](https://www.netflix.com/search?q=3%20body%20problem&jbv=81024821) on Netflix. I watched the Chinese 30 episode show last year which was excellent. The English remake makes it more accessible with a faster pace and even better effects.
