A curated map of everything I create — essays, books, slow living guides, and the inner work behind it all. 

If you're new, start with the first section. If you’re returning, choose what speaks to your season of life.

## 🌱 Start Here

If you’re new to my world, begin here. These links give you the clearest sense of what I believe about living a fulfilling life, why I write, and how I rebuilt everything after my seizures. It’s the foundation for everything else on this site.

    A grounded note each morning to help you live well in a noisy world.

## 🌎 International Living & Travel

I’ve lived abroad full-time since 2016, and it reshaped how I see fulfilment, community, and freedom. These stories and guides show the real expat life — the beauty, the friction, and the lessons that only come from living somewhere long enough to belong.
