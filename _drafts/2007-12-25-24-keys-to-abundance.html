<p>This classic book on law of attraction written way back in 1907, yup 100 years ago is reviewed.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Master Key System by Charles F Haanel was originally written in 1907 and published over a period of 24 weeks in a very widely read New Thought magazine of the time. Nautilus Magazine was produced by Elizabeth Towne, a self-made woman of means, and an accomplished author in her own right. Because of the popularity of this course, Charles Haanel was inspired to publish the first hardcover in 1919. There were over 200,000 copies produced, and all sold extremely well, with a number of later editions coming out up until 1943. The Catholic Church got hold of a copy in 1933, and immediately banned the book from the public, and the elite of the time also attempted to suppress the information, thankfully a number of copies were safely scattered about the globe and to this day have survived, although they are extremely difficult to get now.</p>
<p>The book is the definitive guide to implementing and applying the Law of Attraction, and has a reputation of being the book which has helped to <a href="http://www.nbso.ca/">online casino</a>  create more self-made millionaires than any other book ever published, in fact it is known as "the book that"s made a million millionaires", whether that is a correct figure I don"t know, but the list of people who have studied it and gone on to create huge fortunes is a "who"s who" of the wealthy, and do number in the hundreds of thousands over the last century. Napoleon Hill, author of Think And Grow Rich was a student of Charles Haanel, as was Henry Flagler the Standard Oil Billionaire who applied these Keys to his life and business and formed the largest corporation in US history. Bill Gates is rumored to have got hold of a copy a couple of years into Harvard University, studied it, and dropped out to "put a computer on every desk" and also become one of the richest men on the planet. Hundreds of thousands of people have applied these Keys to their lives and turned everything around for themselves, co-creating a rich and full life of their dreams.</p>
