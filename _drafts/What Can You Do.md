# **What Can You Do? Stop Stressing Over What You Can’t Control**  

Life throws curveballs. Business does too. And if you waste time stressing over things you *can’t* change, you’re just spinning your wheels.  

Here’s the simple mindset that’s kept me sane through decades of entrepreneurship and life’s inevitable chaos:  

1. **Can I change this? Then I do.**  
2. **If I can’t do anything, I let it go.**  

That’s it. No overthinking, no endless worrying, no mental gymnastics.  

## **The Power of Taking Action**  

When something goes wrong, the first question I ask myself is:  

**"Can I do something about this?"**  

If the answer is yes, then I stop whining and get to work.  

- Business partner ghosted me? I find a new one.  
- Customer complaints rolling in? I fix the problem.  
- Revenue down? I tweak my strategy and try something new.  

Action is always better than worry. Sitting around overanalyzing never made anyone successful. Taking action—even imperfect action—moves you forward.  

## **Letting Go of What You Can’t Control**  

Now, here’s the hard part—accepting when something is out of your hands.  

Some things are just *not* up to you:  

- A global recession tanking your industry  
- A social media algorithm change killing your traffic  
- A competitor copying your product and selling it cheaper  

You can complain. You can feel frustrated. But you can’t *change* these things.  

So why waste energy on them?  

The sooner you accept what’s beyond your control, the sooner you can focus on what *is* within your power.  

## **The Secret to a More Peaceful (and Productive) Life**  

Most people stress themselves out by obsessing over things they *wish* they could change but can’t.  

But the people who actually *get ahead* in business and life? They focus only on what they can control and let go of the rest.  

- **You can’t control the economy, but you can adjust your business strategy.**  
- **You can’t control how others act, but you can control how you respond.**  
- **You can’t control the past, but you can decide what you do next.**  

This mindset isn’t just about business—it’s about *everything.*  

Relationships, finances, health, success… if you can do something, then *do* it. If you can’t, then move on.  

That’s how you stay sane. That’s how you keep moving forward.  

So, next time you find yourself stressed out, ask yourself:  

**"Can I change this?"**  

If yes, take action.  
If no, let it go.  

It really is that simple.
