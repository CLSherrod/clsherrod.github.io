<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-4959" title="Seminar" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/posts/2012/04/329649_9775-300x225.jpg" alt="Seminar" width="300" height="225" />I absolutely love Internet Marketers.</p>
<p>Simply because we create solutions that are needed.</p>
<p>I recently had a problem in my business. What I have been doing for years just wasn't working anymore.</p>
<p>My business had grown to a level that what I use to do was totally inadequate. Big time.</p>
<p>I got really overwhelmed because of it. I had to hire and help my partner with assistant stuff, which I really dislike (aka hate).</p>
<p>I was having some issues with the assistant for my partner. They couldn't keep up with her. She moves fast and a regular virtual assistant wasn't cutting it.</p>
<p>I needed to hire someone better that could keep up with my partner.</p>
<p>So I did what I always did, the same hire process I've used for the past 5 years. The next person lasted 3 days before quitting.</p>
<p>Damn, and I had a good hiring process, Top Grading, screening out process, interviews.</p>
<p>This wasn't working.</p>
<p>I knew of a hiring manager but I didn't want to budget for it just for an assistant.</p>
<p>So I looked for some help on hiring people online.</p>
<p>I found a video course on hiring. I bought it, watched the videos in less than an hour and implemented what I learned in another hour.</p>
<p>It worked. It was better than what I had. I've hired two people using the process.</p>
<p>I'm grateful for the help. It has saved my company a lot of time and money.</p>
<p>And this isn't something I could buy in a book. It would be outdated quickly. And I love video or audio, it's quicker. Much much quicker.</p>
<p>I can find, buy, and start learning in about two minutes. It makes traditional "degrees" almost pointless (they are good for getting connections to people, but so is buying a beer at a pub for someone).</p>
<p>So thank you from one Internet Marketing CEO to good content making Internet Marketers. Please keep providing relevant and timely training that bring a return on investment.</p>
