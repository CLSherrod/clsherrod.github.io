One quiet dawn, without a sound,  
Peace broke out, spread all around.  
No fanfare, no grand parade,  
But in the silence, wars did fade.

Borders blurred and then erased,  
Enemies met, embraced with grace.  
Weapons downed, forgotten, cold,  
Hearts grew warm, once bitter, bold.

In every corner of the earth,  
The seeds of peace found their rebirth.  
The guns were gone, the battles ceased,  
And all at once, the world released.

Children laughed in streets so free,  
No fear of what the night might be.  
Homes were filled with joyous song,  
The days were bright, the nights were long.

Leaders sat with open hands,  
No talk of war, no harsh demands.  
They spoke of hope, of dreams to share,  
In a world where peace was everywhere.

The air was light, the sky was clear,  
And all around, there was no fear.  
The future smiled, a friend at last,  
The wounds of war became the past.

Peace broke out and took its stand,  
A quiet force across the land.  
And in that calm, the world found space,  
For love, for life, for warm embrace.
