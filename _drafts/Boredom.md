# **Trying Out Boredom for a Change**  

## **The Hidden Power of Boredom**  

It took me years to realize I should have embraced boredom earlier in life. There was never much incentive. These days, we have an endless supply of distractions at our fingertips—dopamine hits available 24/7 to keep us scrolling, watching, and consuming.  

But for anyone asking, **“What do I even do without technology?”** the answer lies on the **other side** of boredom.  

## **The Other Side of Boredom**  

The "other side" of boredom is when you feel most alive. It’s where you stop running and face the emotions you’ve been avoiding—**discomfort, sadness, restlessness.**  

It’s uncomfortable at first, sure. But then something incredible happens: **you start to notice things.**  

You taste your food instead of inhaling it. You hear the birds outside your window. You watch an entire sunrise and feel happiness—not because something happened, but because you exist.  

And yet, that dopamine-addicted part of our brain whispers, **“Why would I do that when I could just scroll TikTok or watch a YouTube video?”**  

But once you’ve been to the "other side" of boredom, you start to see the **life that’s being stolen from us**—those extraordinary, fleeting moments we miss when we trade them for a screen.  

## **What Are You Really Avoiding?**  

I started noticing that most of my habits—**social media, zoning out on Netflix, even snacking**—were tied to avoiding something.  

I was bored.  
I was angry and searching Reddit for someone who agreed with me.  
I was sad and scrolling for comfort.  

But even when I found the distraction I thought I wanted, **the feelings didn’t go away.**  

## **Facing Discomfort Makes It Weaker**  

Here’s the wild part: when I stopped trying to escape those feelings and instead **leaned into them, they started to fade.**  

Not always, but most of the time, simply **acknowledging** what I was feeling was enough to let it dissolve.  

That’s the strange thing about discomfort—**we resist it so much, but when we actually face it, it loses its grip on us.**  

## **The Superpower of Sitting with Boredom**  

This realization feels like a **superpower**.  

Once you know you can handle emotional discomfort, you stop avoiding the things you know you need to do just because they’re hard. **You start making choices based on your goals and values—not on your fear of discomfort.**  

## **What Really Matters?**  

So ask yourself: **what’s important to you?**  

Stop giving up your life just to avoid **small moments of discomfort**.  

On the other side of boredom lies something far richer: **your life.**
