# Feed Your Soul
# Checklist
- [ ] Publish or schedule the post
- [ ] Promote on social media

Satisfy your soul, not society,
Live your life, stand tall, be proud.
Forget the noise, let go of doubt,
Walk your path, inside and out.

Do no harm, but shine your light,
Follow your passion, burn it bright.
The world may watch, but you must see--
Your life is yours, so let it be.
