The second Play Prosperity Games dinner was a huge hit.  Feedback is great.  Everyone really enjoyed the game we played.  And the ideas were great and based on what people love.  Some truly great ideas were created.  I look forward to people implementing them and then I’ll let you all know about them.  [/excerpt]<br />
