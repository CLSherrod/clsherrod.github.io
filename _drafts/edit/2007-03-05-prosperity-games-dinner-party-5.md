 I had another Play Prosperity Games Dinner Party Friday night in Austin Texas.

  We had so much fun I forgot to take pictures.

  On one of my anonymous feedback forms someone stated that there was too many ideas and to limit it.  I take that as a compliment.  Thank you so much.  I want people to have so many ideas that they pick the one that resonates with them the most.  It is a matter of feeling the inspiration.

  “I laughed most of the night with people I just met.  I was happy to help people experience ideas that they may not have thought of on their own.  Chris was very instructive and clear in his prosperity game process.” - Bruce Burns,  yourownbestgood.com,  Negotiate to your own best good

<p>"I love how everyone contributes in the brainstorming.  This allows for such unique ideas to come forth.  Whenever something is fun, I love it."</p>
<p>"..helps so much in expanding a few little words into a whole biz vision...interaction with others learning what people around you love...a personal experience for everyone."</p>
<p>"Meeting new people, thinking creatively, learning how people think.  Seeing what I have in common with others."</p>
<p>"I like the spontaneity of the game.  The ability to be surprised by what you turn over.  Still being comforted that I knew I liked everything in my cards.  Also liked that this game allows a person to focus on themselves when most of time people are focusing outside themselves (ie work, etc)."</p>
<p>Thank you Suzanne and Bruce for opening up your home for the games.</p>
