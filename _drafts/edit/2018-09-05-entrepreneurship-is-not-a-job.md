There is a lot of entrepreneur training that makes it sound like it’s a job.</p>
<!--more-->
It isn’t.

You pick whether you are an entrepreneur or not.

No one picks you.

You trade a solution with someone that wants a problem solved.

And you solve the problem in a way you are very proud of.

That’s what I love about being an entrepreneur. I solve problems. With a team.

I have a team covering a lot of the world.

It’s great to help my team make more than they could doing anything else.

One goes to the mall every weekend to spend the money she earned helping me.

I’m so proud of her.

And I love our clients getting breakthrus and reaching their potential.

Finding the love of my life is definitely number one in my life but for both of us having a meaningful business is wonderful.

I wish everyone had that, a meaningful business creating solutions that you are proud of.

And I’m here encouraging people to do just that and helping people do that.
