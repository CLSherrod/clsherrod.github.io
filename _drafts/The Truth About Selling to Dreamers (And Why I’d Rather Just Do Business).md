# **The Truth About Selling to Dreamers (And Why I’d Rather Just Do Business)**  

There’s an easy way to make money—**sell to dreamers**.  

Dreamers are everywhere. They buy books, courses, and coaching programs, hoping to strike it rich. But most of them? **They never do anything with what they buy**.  

They’ll buy one thing, never use it, and then buy the next shiny offer that promises success. It’s an endless cycle, and plenty of people **make a fortune selling empty promises**.  

## **The Business of Selling the Dream**  

There are entire industries built around **selling people the idea of success** rather than actually helping them achieve it.  

- I’ve seen marketers fake testimonials to make their offers look legitimate.  
- I’ve watched people sell courses on “getting clients” after landing just one client themselves.  
- I even knew someone who pre-sold a **$50,000 website package** while their own website wasn’t even finished.  

It’s a game. The money **isn’t in doing the business—it’s in teaching the business**.  

It’s just like universities. Most professors **haven’t actually built businesses** in the subjects they teach. They failed at the real thing, so they teach it instead.  

## **If You’re Going to Teach, Actually Do the Work First**  

I don’t have a problem with teaching—**as long as it’s real**.  

I believe if you’re going to sell advice, it should be a **small percentage** of your income. The majority should come from **actually doing the thing you’re teaching**.  

That’s why I focus on my own work. Instead of selling “success formulas,” I write essays on my website about what’s actually worked for me. **No hype, no gimmicks—just experience.**  

## **Most People Just Need to Get to Work**  

The truth is, success doesn’t come from **buying courses** or **chasing the next big thing**. It comes from **doing the work, failing, learning, and trying again**.  

If you’re serious about building something, stop looking for shortcuts. Stop throwing money at people who sell you dreams.  

Just **start.**  

Because while dreamers keep buying, **doers are out there actually making things happen.**
