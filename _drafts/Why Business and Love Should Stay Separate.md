# **Why Business and Love Should Stay Separate**  

### **Partnerships Are Harder Than Marriage**  

I’ve been in business for a long time, and I’ve been in love for a long time. Let me tell you—business partnerships are harder than marriage.  

Marriage is built on love, trust, and commitment. Business partnerships, even with people you trust, add an extra layer of complexity: money, responsibilities, decision-making, and risk. The stakes are different, and when you mix business with personal relationships, things can get messy fast.  

That’s why I have one simple rule: **never go into business with someone you love.**  

### **Support, Don’t Own**  

If your spouse or partner wants to start their own business, **don’t become their business partner.** Instead, just support them. Give them money to start it if you can afford to, but don’t own a piece of it. If they want advice, give it freely—without expectation. If your company provides a service they need, offer them a deal, but be okay with them using someone else in the future.  

Keeping things separate ensures that your relationship stays strong, regardless of what happens with their business. Because businesses fail. Even the best ones. If you’re financially or emotionally entangled in a failing business, it can take your relationship down with it.  

### **Independence Creates a Better Relationship**  

A strong relationship thrives when both people have their own independence. If one person is relying on the other financially or professionally, the power dynamic shifts. It’s no longer just about love and support—it’s about business, responsibility, and financial pressure. That’s a recipe for resentment.  

When both people have their own careers, their own income, and their own ambitions, the relationship stays balanced. You’re together because you **want** to be, not because you **have** to be.  

### **My Personal Experience**  

Years ago, I had a paying client that I became romantically involved with. The moment we got together, I stopped charging her. Any advice I gave her was free from then on, and that won’t change—unless her company’s accountants decide otherwise. That’s their business, not mine.  

This approach has made things simple. She runs her business. I run mine. We support each other without entangling our finances, and it keeps our relationship strong.  

### **Keep Love First, Business Second**  

The bottom line? Love is more important than business. Keep the two separate. Support your partner, but let them be independent. If they want to start something, cheer them on. Help if you can, but don’t get financially tied up in it.  

Because at the end of the day, businesses come and go—but a strong, loving relationship is what truly matters.
