<p>This morning one of my other Wordpress installations emailed me saying some IP address from China was trying to login as user admin. They got locked out because I have limit login lockout to lock people out after so many unsuccessful. I use Wordfence Security plugin (<a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordfence/">https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordfence/</a>). I did double check all it's recommendations to make sure I did everything.</p>
<p>Also a good idea to have your entire Wordpress site backed up off server. I use UpdraftPlus Backup/Restore (<a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/updraftplus/">https://wordpress.org/plugins/updraftplus/</a>) and have multiple versions stored over on Amazon S3.</p>
<p>These two plugins will secure you to make you an incredible hard target to hack. Hackers will most likely just move on to someone else that hasn't secured their website.</p>
