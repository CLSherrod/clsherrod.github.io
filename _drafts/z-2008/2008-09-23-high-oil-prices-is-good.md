High oil prices are good?&nbsp; Why when everyone on the news says it's bad?&nbsp; When all your neighbors and friends say it is bad?

Because high oil prices is creating a market for alternative energy, conversation, efficiency and energy independence.

The growing demand of oil is growing faster than the long term supply curve of oil.&nbsp; Demand has to decrease and/or alternative energy has to exist.&nbsp; The longer oil is priced high the better.&nbsp; It gives people time to transition from their old car to a new hybrid or alternative fuel vehicle or simply take the metro.

Natural gas, solar, tar sand, plant waste, biodiese,&nbsp; hydrogen, plug-in hybrid vehicles, shale, Synthetic diesel, coal-to-liquid processing, wind, tidal wouldn't be viable with cheap oil.&nbsp; There are so many new options that are viable because oil is expensive.

There is plenty of energy out there for everyone to use, it is just a matter of finding it.&nbsp; The technology finds will be fantastic as scientists and entreprenuers have an incentive to come out with the energy solution that changes everything.

And high prices helps the environment with a reduction of hydrocarbons.&nbsp; Alternative energy is more earth friendly too.

So high oil prices are the perfect solution to meeting the growing energy demand, helping out the environment.&nbsp; Have a smile next time you pay $70 filling your car with gasoline, you're helping solve energy and the environment.
