I saw "Gang Of Four" an English punk rock band from the 70's last night and it reminded me I really love punk rock bands.

Punk rock bands have a message of independence.

Supporting the underdog.

Making things right.

Justice. Shining the light on injustice.

I find punk rock to be very moving and uplifting. I don't find it depressing at all. It's empowering.

Here's to all the musician, artists and writers out there uplifting us all.
