# Life Before Business
In my early-twenties, I found myself immersed in the early stages of entrepreneurship, dedicating every spare moment to it. As I journeyed through this phase, I realized that my then-girlfriend was only receiving very little of my time and energy. Recognizing this wasn't the foundation for a lasting relationship, and she broke up with me on New Years Eve.

I made a conscious choice. If I truly valued any relationship, I had to prioritize it. 

There were times I didn't date because I didn't have the time. 

I’ve lost a number of girlfriends because of being a workaholic. When I found my love of my life I made her the top priority because I knew how rare she was. I even didn’t pursue some new opportunities because it would greatly impact my time.

For the subsequent almost two decades, I've been unwaveringly committed to ensuring our bond remains at the forefront of my life.
