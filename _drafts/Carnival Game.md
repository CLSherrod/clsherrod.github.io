## Title
The Hard Truth About Entrepreneurship (That No One Wants to Admit)
## Essay
## Life Lessons From a Retired Entrepreneur Who's Seen It All

Ever play one of those carnival games where you throw darts at a target?

I remember standing at one as a teenager, a crumpled dollar in my hand, trying to win a stuffed animal for a girl I liked. One throw. That’s all I could afford. I missed, of course. We laughed it off, but deep down I felt the sting.

Years later, running my own businesses, I realized that carnival game was a pretty good metaphor for how entrepreneurship really works—especially in America.

## Not Everyone Starts at the Same Line

Here’s the truth no one talks about enough: success in business isn’t just about grit and hustle. It’s also about how many throws you get.

Middle-class folks? We usually get one or two shots at the board. Maybe you scrape together savings, max out a credit card, or take out a small business loan. You make your throw and hope to hit something. Most don’t. Some hit the outer rings and walk away with a “thanks for playing” kind of win. A rare few nail the bullseye—and those are the stories we love to share.

But here’s the kicker: the rich kids? They can afford as many throws as they want. They try, fail, try again, pivot, hire help, fire help, take a sabbatical, come back, and throw again. Eventually, they hit something. Maybe even the center. Then they go on podcasts and talk about how “hard work always wins.” Give me a break.

And the poor kids? They’re not even playing. They’re the ones running the booth. Punching timecards. Counting other people’s throws.

## It’s Not Fair—But It’s Still Worth Trying

Now, I’m not telling you this to discourage you. I’m saying it because it’s the reality I’ve lived and witnessed for decades.

I started one of my first businesses out of a tiny apartment with a hand-me-down desk and dial-up internet. I didn’t have a safety net. Every throw I made had to count, or I was toast.

But I kept going. I stayed scrappy. I paid attention to what worked—and more importantly, what didn’t. I didn’t waste energy pretending I had the same advantages others did. I just played my game, my way.

## The Real Secret? Make Your Throw Count

If you’ve only got one dart, don’t throw it blind. Prepare. Learn. Test your aim. Talk to people who’ve thrown before. And don’t let someone who’s had 100 tries tell you you’re just not trying hard enough.

Entrepreneurship isn’t a level playing field. But it’s still one of the few places where persistence, creativity, and guts can move the needle—sometimes more than money does.

So if you're standing there with your one shot, take it. But know what you're up against. And if you do hit the bullseye? Be honest about how you got there.

That's how we make the game better for the next folks in line.

The Harsh Truth About Entrepreneurship No One Talks About
### Email Body
Ever feel like entrepreneurship is rigged?

Like some folks get unlimited chances to "figure it out" while others have to get it right on the first try—or lose everything?

I just published a new essay that dives into this exact reality. It’s called:

**“The Hard Truth About Entrepreneurship (That No One Wants to Admit)”**  
and you can read it here:  
**[ChristopherSherrod.com/carnival-game](https://christophersherrod.com/carnival-game)**

In it, I share a story from my younger years that stuck with me, and how it later shaped how I see the business world. I talk about the different kinds of "throws" we each get in life—and how success often has more to do with access than hustle.

But don’t worry—this isn’t a rant or a pity party.

It’s a practical reflection from someone who’s been in the game a long time and wants to share a few things I’ve learned the hard way.

**If you’ve ever wondered why some people seem to "make it" while others keep grinding… this one’s for you.**

Give it a read and let me know what you think:

P.S. If you’ve only got one dart to throw, you better make it count. I show you how in the essay.
