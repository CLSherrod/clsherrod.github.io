# **Months in Silence: What I Learned from Sensory Isolation**  

When I had my seizure, my world suddenly went silent. I couldn’t listen to music, watch TV, or tolerate any noise or screens. For months, I was trapped in sensory isolation—like a silent monastery, but without the option to leave.  

And it wasn’t just the silence. I was **constantly overheated**, unable to cool off no matter what I did. My body felt like it was running on overdrive, and nothing seemed to help. On top of that, I was **extremely sensitive to light**, forcing me to **wear sunglasses in my darkened bedroom** just to keep from being overwhelmed.  

At first, it was unbearable. My mind raced nonstop, desperate for distraction. I kept thinking about everything I was missing—conversations, music, and the simple background sounds of life. My brain felt like a cluttered room with no way to clean it up.  

But then, something changed.  

## **Silence Forced Me to Face Myself**  

We rarely experience true silence anymore. Every spare moment is filled with scrolling, TV, podcasts, or background noise. Even when we’re alone, we’re not really alone—we’re constantly plugged into something.  

But when all of that was stripped away, I had no choice but to sit with my own thoughts. At first, it was uncomfortable, even overwhelming. I had to face things I had been avoiding. But over time, it became freeing.  

Without distractions, my thoughts slowed down. My mind cleared, like a messy desk finally getting organized. I started noticing things I had never paid attention to before—the way the light shifted (even though I could barely stand to see it), the subtleties of my breath, the quiet hum of existence that’s always there but so easily drowned out.  

## **Boredom Isn’t the Enemy—It’s a Gift**  

Before this experience, I had forgotten what real boredom felt like. As a kid, I had plenty of it—staring out the window on long drives, waiting for my parents, zoning out in class. But as an adult, I had always kept myself busy.  

It turns out, **boredom is valuable.**  

When there’s nothing to do, your mind has space to wander, reflect, and process. It’s uncomfortable at first, but eventually, it leads to clarity. Some people go on silent retreats to achieve this. I had it forced upon me, but the lesson was the same: **silence isn’t empty—it’s full of answers.**  

## **How to Find Silence in a Noisy World**  

The monks I read about don’t live in complete silence, but they do sit quietly for 30 minutes twice a day—no reading, no praying, just sitting.  

Naval Ravikant describes a similar practice:  

> "Sit for 60 minutes every day for at least 60 days. Don't force anything. Let your mind do what it wants. Over time, you clear out the mental clutter, and real clarity emerges."  

I won’t say I enjoyed every moment of those months without sound, comfort, or light. It was hard. But it changed me.  

Now, even though I’ve regained my ability to listen and watch, I **choose** silence more often. Just 30 minutes of stillness a day makes a difference.  

If you’re feeling overwhelmed by life’s noise, try it. You don’t need a monastery—or a medical crisis—to find the peace that silence can bring.
