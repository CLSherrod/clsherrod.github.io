<p>My team has been busy restructuring some systems. Making things easier for maintenance which costs money as I have hired people to do most all of it.</p>
<p>Replacing some paid monthly systems with our own self-hosted systems because it give us more control.</p>
<p>And we finally made all the non-transactionalble websites secure, it isn't required since they were not taking any transactions but some people would send in support tickets that our WordPress sites weren't secure, so I just made everything secure. Changing from http to https with CloudFlare made my team member Shari's task pretty easy.</p>
<p>Tip: CloudFlare does have free https with each account. And WordPress Multi Site is pretty awesome. One brand has one WordPress install handling four sites. And another brand two.</p>
<p>One of the changes is my own blog has moved to christopher-sherrod.blisslifepress.com.</p>
<p>So welcome to my new home. I've been blogging since 2000, that's 19 years. And my blog has been on three urls so far. Wow.</p>
