## My Upbringing: From Poverty to Prosperity

When I was growing up, my parents had a remarkable story. They came from poor backgrounds but worked tirelessly to achieve great success, eventually owning a log mansion and several planes in Alaska. They were blunt about the challenges I would face in adulthood, emphasizing the importance of continuous growth and hard work. Their entire lives had been an uphill climb, and they didn't believe mine would be any different.

## Reframing the Struggle for My Kids

Indeed, my life has been and continues to be an uphill climb. However, I strive to frame this struggle differently for my children. I believe success isn't just about reaching the top but about the journey itself and finding joy along the way. For me, raising a happy family is the ultimate measure of success.

## The Value of Plateaus

I tell my kids that while life is still an uphill climb, there are moments on the plateaus—where I can stop and enjoy the fruits of years of hard work—that make it all worthwhile. These moments of rest and reflection are incredibly fulfilling and offer a chance to appreciate the journey.

## A Fulfilling Life with Just Enough

I have a fulfilling life, and although I can't directly compare my experiences to my parents', I can share valuable lessons with my children. They need to know that they can be happy and successful with just enough. True happiness and success come from finding balance, cherishing the moments of rest, and appreciating the journey, no matter how steep the climb.

By teaching my kids that the journey is just as important as the destination, I hope to instill in them a sense of resilience and contentment that will serve them well throughout their lives.
