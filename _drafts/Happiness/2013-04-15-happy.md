So many people talk about making lot's of money. I use to myself.

But, I really just want to be happy.

And I am. And I see so many people that are not.

I'm curious why people are so unhappy, because life is really awesome.

So I started studying people that we happy regardless of how much money they make.

I found interesting results.

I've meet many people that are very rich and completely unhappy, miserable really. It concerned me so much that I thought making a lot of money would totally suck.

But, I've meet many people that make a lot of money and incredibly happy.

What's the difference?

It's purpose. It's doing what you love.

Yes a minimum amount of income is essential to be happy, but above that....not really. That minimum depends per individual and where you live in the world.

Don't worry about how much money you make. Don't worry about keeping up with the "Joneses". Be happy. That's it.

It's up to you to lead a happy life, not any one else. Choose wisely.
