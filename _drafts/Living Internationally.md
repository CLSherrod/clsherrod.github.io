Thinking about moving abroad? Slow down for a second. Living internationally looks glamorous online—but the real test happens far from beaches and Instagram feeds. Before packing up your life, **see if you can handle the everyday reality** first.

## Step 1: Take a “Reality Vacation”

Don’t stay in a resort. Instead, rent a local apartment or Airbnb and live like you already live there.

- Shop at local grocery stores.
    
- Go to the mall or open-air market.
    
- Join a group that matches your interests—yoga, hiking, art, whatever feels natural.
    

These simple things show you what daily life actually feels like. The rhythm, the pace, even the smells.

## Step 2: Test the Utilities—Yes, Really

Here’s where the fantasy usually breaks.

Visit the **local electricity utility office**. Stand in line. Watch how long it takes to get help. Then go to an **internet provider office** and ask questions about setting up service.

When I moved abroad, I had to visit my internet provider **five times in a month** just to get online.  
On the first visit, I watched a foreigner lose his temper—screaming at the staff out of pure frustration.

That’s when I realized: _if this part drives you crazy, you won’t last here._

So even if you’re just Airbnb-ing, take a few hours to experience it.  
See if the process frustrates or fascinates you. **Can you handle it?**

## Step 3: Try Several Locations

Every country—and every city—feels different. Try a few before you commit. Spend a month in each and compare.

Notice:

- Do you like small towns or big cities?
    
- How do you handle language barriers?
    
- Can you adapt when things move slower (or faster) than home?
    

You’re not vacationing—you’re auditioning your next life.

## Step 4: Ease Into Full-Time

Once you’ve found a few places that feel right, spend part of the year abroad. Maybe start with three months, then six.

That way you’ll learn how local systems really work:

- Banking, healthcare, visas, taxes
- Weather changes by season
- Local customs and community rhythms

Only after that should you think about staying full-time.

## Step 5: Don’t Buy Too Soon

Never buy property—especially **pre-construction**—until you’ve lived in the area for a while and talked to other expats and locals who’ve done the same.

You need time to see how a neighbourhood evolves, how construction is handled, and what living there really costs.

There’s no rush. Buying early locks you in before you even know if it fits.

I bought my home during the pandemic and got a great deal—but that only worked because I had been living here for years. I knew the area, and already had a highly referred realtor and lawyer. I knew how things actually moved in this market.

Without that experience, it would’ve been a gamble.

## Living Abroad the Smart Way

Living internationally can be deeply rewarding—freedom, perspective, simplicity—but only when it fits your temperament.

So take your time.  
Test reality before you trade your whole life for it.

If you still love it after waiting in line at the internet office five times in the heat, congratulations—you’re probably ready.
