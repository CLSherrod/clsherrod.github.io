# **Starting a Business? Focus on Paying Customers First**  

## **It’s Hard and Expensive—That’s the Reality**  

Starting a business is **hard** and **expensive**.  

Every B2B company out there assumes, *“Well, our customers are businesses. They make money, so they can afford to pay us more.”* And they’re not wrong—**when the business is already making money**.  

But when you’re just starting out, **everything feels expensive**. Every tool, every hire, every service—it all adds up. And if you’re not careful, you can burn through cash before you even have a single paying customer.  

## **Finding Customers from Zero Is the Hardest Part**  

The hardest part of starting a business isn’t setting up an LLC. It’s not designing a website. It’s not even figuring out what to sell.  

The hardest part is **getting that first paying customer.**  

It’s easy to assume, *“There’s a lot of demand for what I’m offering.”* But **demand in theory doesn’t pay the bills**. You need actual people, with names and faces, who are willing to **pull out their wallet** and pay for what you’re selling.  

## **How to Start the Right Way**  

If you want to start a business, forget the paperwork for a second. Forget the fancy branding. Focus on this:  

1. **Find real people who want what you’re selling.**  
   - Not a vague audience—real people who say, *“Yes, I will pay for that.”*  

2. **Talk to as many of those people as possible.**  
   - Understand their problems, needs, and what they’d actually pay for.  

3. **Sell to them first.**  
   - Before you worry about business structures or scaling, prove that someone will buy.  

4. **Then worry about the legal stuff.**  
   - Once you’ve got paying customers, then set up your LLC, website, and all the other details.  

## **Businesses That Fail vs. Businesses That Win**  

The businesses that struggle spend months **perfecting their logo, writing a business plan, and worrying about taxes—before they’ve made a single sale**.  

The businesses that succeed? They find paying customers **first**.  

Because if you can’t sell one, you can’t sell a hundred.  

## **Your Business Doesn’t Exist Until Someone Pays You**  

It’s easy to feel like you’re making progress when you’re working on your website or setting up an LLC. But **none of that matters if you don’t have paying customers**.  

So if you’re serious about starting a business, start with this:  

- **Find someone who will buy what you’re selling.**  
- **Sell it to them.**  
- **Then build from there.**  

Everything else is secondary.
