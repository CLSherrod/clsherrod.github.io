# The most powerful life hacks I've discovered

[METHOD] The most powerful life hacks I've discovered:

**Go Outside for 15 Minutes Every Morning**

Get sunlight in your eyes every morning.

Sunlight:

- Sets your circadium rhythm
• Primes your brain to be alert and focused
• Enhances metabolism and immune functionality

Watch this transform your overall mood and well-being.

**Meditate Daily**

All of man’s problems come because he cannot sit by himself in a room for 30 minutes.

Our society is filled with:

- Cheap dopamine
• Constant notifications
• Screens everywhere we look

Take time to slow down and be present.

**Surround Yourself With Optimists**

Who you surround yourself with has a bigger influence on you than you know.

You’re the average of the 5 people you spend the most time with.

Each of those 5 should be someone pushing you forward.

Choose who you spend your time with wisely.

**Practice Gratitude**

Gratitude is a key ingredient for living a fulfilling life.

Gratitude helps people:

- Feel more positive emotions.
• Build strong relationships
• Improve their health

Take 5 minutes/day to write down 5 things you're grateful for.

**Build a Personal Board of Advisors**

Don’t underestimate the power of a mentor.

Epictetus mentored Marcus Aurelius.
Jobs mentored Zuckerberg.
Buffet mentored Gates.

Seek advice from people 2-3 steps ahead of you.

You can access their lifetime of wisdom in 2-3 years

**Write Every Day**

Writing is essential in unleashing your creative potential.

Writing every day:

- Builds discipline
• Allows you to organize your thinking
• Improves your vocabulary and communication skills

Mastering this skill will lead to success in the modern economy.

**Invest in Yourself**

We spend 8 hours a day working for someone else.

But won’t take 30 minutes to work on ourselves.

Invest in yourself through:

- Reading
• Exercising
• Learning a new skill

Just 30 minutes a day can change your life.

**Block Off Time to Read**

The most successful people in the world have one thing in common:

They love to read.

- Read about things that interest you
• Re-read your favorite books
• Read every day

An hour a day of reading puts you in the top .01% of people.

**Take a Cold Shower**

A 3-minute cold shower will provide you benefits that last the rest of the day.

Taking a cold shower:

- Increases dopamine
• Boosts metabolism
• Burns brown fat

Anything else you have to do afterward will seem easy.

**Set a Bedtime Alarm**

After this alarm goes off, allow your mind to relax:

- Turn off all your devices
• Take a warm shower or bath
• Read your favorite fiction book

Setting yourself up for success the next day starts the night before
