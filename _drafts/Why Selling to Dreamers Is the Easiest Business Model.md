## Title
The Mirage Merchants: Why Selling to Dreamers Is the Easiest Business Model

## The Perfect Customer Who Never Demands Results

The most profitable business isn't selling products that work – it's selling dreams that never materialize. I've watched the business coaching  industry from the inside for two decades, and the math is brutally simple: selling to dreamers is nearly foolproof.

Why? Because dreamers make perfect customers. They buy eagerly, rarely implement, and never demand proof. When one program fails to deliver, they blame themselves, not your product. Then they purchase your next offering, convinced this one will unlock their success.

## The Implementation Gap That Powers Billion-Dollar Industries

Industry insiders know the numbers: roughly 80% of course customers never complete what they purchase. Of the remaining 20%, only a fraction implement anything. This creates the perfect scenario – thousands of customers, virtually zero accountability.

I've seen marketers build empires on this foundation. They create course after course, masterclass after masterclass, each promising the transformation that the previous one somehow didn't deliver.

## The Testimonial Factory: How Success Stories Are Manufactured

The ecosystem sustains itself through carefully curated "success stories." I've known people who faked testimonials entirely. Others who landed one client, then immediately sold a $2,000 course on "client acquisition." One colleague pre-sold a $50,000 website development package while his own site was still being built by someone else.

The real money isn't in doing the business – it's in teaching the business. It's in becoming the guru rather than the practitioner.

## The Academic Model: Teaching What You've Never Done

This model mirrors academia perfectly. Universities employ professors who teach business without having built one. They teach marketing without having marketed anything. They teach entrepreneurship without having entrepreneured.

The guru industry operates the same way. The teacher isn't a successful practitioner sharing knowledge – they're often a failed practitioner who found teaching more profitable than doing.

## The Ethical Alternative: Teach What You've Mastered

I believe teaching should represent a small percentage of what you make. The majority should come from actually doing the thing you claim expertise in.

This is why I've focused on building my businesses first and teaching second. The essays on my website share what's actually worked – not theory, not hope, but battle-tested approaches that delivered results.

For every essay and email I write, I spend a week overseeing business. This keeps my essays grounded in reality rather than floating in abstraction.

## The Dreamer's Defense: How to Avoid Becoming The Target

If you're pursuing a dream, demand evidence. Look beyond testimonials. Ask for verified results. Question whether your guru makes most of their money from doing or teaching.

The most valuable lessons I've learned came from practitioners who reluctantly taught, not teachers who occasionally practice.

The dream-selling industry isn't going anywhere. It's too profitable, too scalable, and too protected by the psychology of hope. But understanding how it works is your first defense against becoming its next ideal customer.
