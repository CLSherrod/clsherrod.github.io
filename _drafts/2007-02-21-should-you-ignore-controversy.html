excerpt: |-
  Many of my mentors and friends are discussing an on-line controversy.  They have long posts about it.  But, the very act of discussing it is adding to the controversy.  Which is why I'm not even going to mention what the controversy is about.  I don't want to add to it.

  I choose to simply ignore it.

<p>Many of my mentors and friends are discussing an on-line controversy.  They have long posts about it.  But, the very act of discussing it is adding to the controversy.  Which is why I'm not even going to mention what the controversy is about.  I don't want to add to it.</p>
<p>I choose to simply ignore it.</p>
<p>I don't believe there is a controversy.</p>
<p>I know what works for me and my friend and associates. And discussing whether something is or isn't true when I know it is true is pointless to me and a complete waste of time.</p>
<p>Which is my I don't watch the news.  It's pointless to watch violence and bad news when all of it is completely out of my control.  If I watch it I start thinking about it, which can bring it into my life.  So I don't watch any of it.  If something really big happens I'll hear about it.  Repeatly.</p>
<p>Focus on what you want and it will manifest.  Don't let talk of controversy get in your way.</p>
