# **The Life Cycle of a Business Model: How to Spot the Right Opportunities**  

Every money-making opportunity follows a **predictable life cycle**.  

From social media platforms to marketing tactics to new product types—**everything goes through the same phases**. If you can recognize **where an opportunity is in its life cycle**, you can **make smarter decisions** about when to jump in and how to succeed.  

I’ve seen this cycle play out **dozens of times** in my career. Here’s how it works:  

## **Phase 1: The Innovators**  

This is the **golden phase** where only a few people know about the opportunity.  

The **early movers** in this stage make the easiest money. There’s no competition, buyers are excited, and success happens fast.  

But the key thing about innovators? They **don’t talk about it**.  

They know they’ve found something special, and they want to maximize it before the secret gets out. Many of them also end up **building tools and services** that others will use later.  

For example, when **print-on-demand** was just taking off, Tom Bell was an innovator. He didn’t just sell products—he created **ViralStyle**, a platform that let others do the same.  

## **Phase 2: The Educators**  

This is when the opportunity starts to **get noticed**.  

People who weren’t the earliest adopters—but who are still paying attention—jump in. These **educators** take what the innovators were doing and **package it into courses, guides, and systems**.  

I often find myself in this phase. I don’t take the biggest risks, but when I see an opportunity **working**, I start sharing it.  

At this stage, it’s still possible to get **great results**, but the **easy money starts to disappear**. More people are doing it, and competition starts to heat up.  

## **Phase 3: The Dark Years**  

This is where **reality hits**.  

The opportunity is no longer a “secret.” Everyone and their cousin is trying to cash in. Competition skyrockets, and **lazy businesses get wiped out**.  

At this stage, platforms and regulations **start cracking down**. The loopholes and easy tricks that worked before? They stop working.  

A lot of people **burn out and move on**. They look for the next “new thing” instead of **adapting** and improving their business. But those who **stick around and refine their strategy**? They’re the ones who will **thrive in the next phase**.  

## **Phase 4: True Quality Wins**  

By this point, most people believe the opportunity is **dead**.  

They say things like:  
*“Nobody makes money from that anymore.”*  
*“That’s saturated.”*  
*“You have to move on.”*  

And yet—this is **exactly when real businesses start making serious money**.  

Why? Because all the **short-term players are gone**. The people left are the ones **who built something solid**. The rules are clear, the quality is high, and success is no longer about timing—it’s about **skill, consistency, and real business fundamentals**.  

Think about **email marketing**. Young marketers today say, *“Email is dead.”* Meanwhile, I know **multiple 8-figure earners** who rely on email as their main revenue driver.  

## **How to Play the Game Smarter**  

Recognizing where an opportunity is in its life cycle is **key to long-term success**.  

- **Phase 1 (Innovation) is risky but has massive rewards.**  
- **Phase 2 (Education) is the easiest time to learn and jump in.**  
- **Phase 3 (Dark Years) will test you—but if you adapt, you’ll survive.**  
- **Phase 4 (True Quality) is when the real winners emerge.**  

So next time you see a “new opportunity,” ask yourself: **Where are we in the cycle?**  

Because once you understand the game, **you can play it on your own terms.**
