<p>There is a lot of entrepreneur training that makes it sound like it's a job.</p>
<p>It isn't.</p>
<p>You pick whether you are an entrepreneur or not.</p>
<p>No one picks you.</p>
<p>You trade a solution with someone that wants a problem solved.</p>
<p>And you solve the problem in a way you are very proud of.</p>
<p>That's what I love about being an entrepreneur. I solve problems. With a team.</p>
<p>I have a team covering a lot of the world.</p>
<p>It's great to help my team make more than they could doing anything else.</p>
<p>One goes to the mall every weekend to spend the money she earned helping me.</p>
<p>I'm so proud of her.</p>
<p>And I love our clients getting breakthrus and reaching their potential.</p>
<p>Finding the love of my life is definitely number one in my life but for both of us having a meaningful business is wonderful.</p>
<p>I wish everyone had that, a meaningful business creating solutions that you are proud of.</p>
<p>And I'm here encouraging people to do just that and helping people do that.</p>
