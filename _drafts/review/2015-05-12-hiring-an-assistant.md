I've had an assistant since 2000. Started off as occasionally to part-time to full-time.

Right even with hiring an accountant I think getting an assistant is your first hire.

It's that helpful.

Having written procedures so that when you add team members they can get up and running quickly. It also helps if someone quits or gets hit by a bus.

Here is my <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/christophersherrod/hireassistant/VA+Job+Posting.txt">job posting template</a> I use over at <a href="http://upwork.com">upwork</a>.

And my <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/christophersherrod/hireassistant/Standard+Operating+Procedure+(SOP)+Template.txt">standard operating procedure template</a>. Modify it to suite your needs.
