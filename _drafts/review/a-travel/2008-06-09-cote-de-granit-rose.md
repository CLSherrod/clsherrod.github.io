Once we made it to the village out of the Cote de Granit Rose we stopped at a restaurant that our book said was the best around the area.  It had a fantastic view of the marina and the food was top notch.  Fantastic.  The sea bass with a local cider sauce was wonderful.  Great French wine to top it off.

Then we drove the last bit to Cote de Granit Rose.  I bought a French captain hat.  I love hats and always buy a hat to where I travel.  The we saw the rose granite coast. Wow.  Beautiful.  Great formations and interesting shapes.  I did a photography project years ago about rocks and shot the Grand Canyon and other formations in Arizona and these rocks would fit in well with that project.

There was a lighthouse made of the local granite and I can see why they need a lighthouse.  Rocks everywhere and very windy.  Not friendly to boats.  It was kinda of cool and the local shop was selling swimsuits but how anyone can use them here I have no idea.

The drive back was much easier and took at least 2/3 of the time.  Only got lost once once we hit Rennes but recovered beautifully.
