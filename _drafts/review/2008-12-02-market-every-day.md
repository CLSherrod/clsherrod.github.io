<p>I doing marketing every day (except weekends of course).  If you market every day then your stream of business stays fairly constant.  If you get so busy that you can't market for a month then your sales funnel will suffer.  You'll notice that you won't have any business and will be able to market full time and make no money.  Not good.</p>
<p>Here's a great quote from Seth.</p>
>We tend to reserve the third bucket, initiate, for quiet times, good times, down times or desperate times. We wait until the inbox is empty or the new product lines are due (at which point the initiative is more of a response). It's possible to spend an entire day blogging and twittering and facebooking and never initiate a thing, just respond to what's coming in. It's possible to spend an entire day at P&amp;G (actually it's possible to spend an entire career) doing nothing but responding...</p>
<p>Take a look at your Sent folder. Is it filled with subject lines that start with RE: ? Consider your job at the University--do you actively recruit people who don't even apply for professorships? What about your blog--does it start conversations or just continue them?</p>
<p>What did your brand or organization initiate today?</p>
<p>What did you initiate?</p>
<p>Think about the changes you'd have to make (uh oh, initiate) in your work day in order to dramatically change the quantity and scale of the initiatives you create.</p>
<p>Some marketing jobs are about responding. None are about reacting. The best ones are about initiating.</p></blockquote>
