<p>I had a former neighbor tell me recently that she really looked up to me.</p>
<p>She told me that I was so good at being social.</p>
<p>I was shocked.</p>
<p>That is one thing I definitely didn't think I was good at.</p>
<p>But it made me think.</p>
<p>I've recently been in a professional photo show. I've done Improv Comedy in front of a paying audience.</p>
<p>I know quite a few people at the Internet Marketing Party that I talked about a couple of days ago. And I talk to as many as I can at that.</p>
<p>I enjoy hanging out with people.</p>
<p>My girlfriend evens says that I'm a great friend because I regularly checkin with my friends just to see what's up.</p>
<p>But, I still didn't think I was that social.</p>
<p>My perception was completely different than what people around me were thinking.</p>
<p>I've chosen to change that perception. I did it by learning Improv Comedy, getting into a professional photo show and asking for what</p>
<p>I want. Doing my radio show and asking for guests that I want to talk to has also helped a lot. And by listening to my friends.</p>
<p>What perception do you have that is completely false?</p>
<p>Having good friends that will tell you the honest truth (most don't) is the best way I know how to find these false perceptions.</p>
