>When you live in tandem with your spirit, appreciating all of life and what you have, you discover more joy and kindness in the world.

This circle of peace grows and you return to your natural state of joy, love and peace, knowing you are whole and complete just as you are.<br />
Gratitude is not only the greatest of virtues, but the parent of all the others. ~ Cicero</p></blockquote>
