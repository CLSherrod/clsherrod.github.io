So many people talk about making lots of money. I used to myself. But now, I really just want to be happy. And I am. However, I see so many people who are not. I'm curious why people are so unhappy because life is really awesome. So I started studying people who are happy regardless of how much money they make.

## The Quest for Happiness

I found interesting results. I've met many people who are very rich and completely unhappyâ€”miserable, really. It concerned me so much that I thought making a lot of money would totally suck. But, I've also met many people who make a lot of money and are incredibly happy. What's the difference?

## The Key to Happiness: Purpose and Passion

It's purpose. It's doing what you love. Yes, a minimum amount of income is essential to be happy, but beyond that... not really. That minimum depends on the individual and where you live in the world. Don't worry about how much money you make. Don't worry about keeping up with the "Joneses." Be happy. That's it.

## Resources for a Happy Life

Check out the movies [Happy](http://www.thehappymovie.com/) and [Finding Joe](http://findingjoethemovie.com/) for tips on how to have a happy life. As Joseph Campbell wisely said, "We must be willing to get rid of the life we've planned so as to have the life that is waiting for us." It's up to you to lead a happy life, not anyone else. Choose wisely.

## The Importance of Self-Determined Happiness

Everyone at their core wants to be happy. It doesn't have to be about making tons of money. I've met many people who have made a lot of money and are unbelievably unhappy. They thought money would make them happy. It does help up to a certain level, but it doesn't make you happy. You make yourself happy.

## Live for Yourself, Not Others

Do what you want to do to be happy. Nobody else's opinion counts. So many people are fooling themselves about their life. "I'm important, I'm needed, I have to do this." No, you don't. You have to live your life for you. You have to have fun. You have to feel helpful to others.

## Overcoming Fear and Judgment

So, what's stopping you? What others would think? Believe that some people don't like you. It's inevitable. There is no way around it. But it doesn't matter. Only you matter. It's all about you and how you feel when you help others.

## Overcoming Personal Struggles

I've been depressed a few times in my life. I believe entrepreneurs have this problem more often than most because we push ourselves more than most. And not everything goes as planned. At times, I've had to watch quite a few YouTube videos on how to be happy. They have helped a great deal along with daily meditation and my morning routine. And learning not to care too much about what some others think.

## Creating Your Ideal Day

I will purposely do things to become happy so that I can get back to my ideal day, be productive, and live a life worth living.
