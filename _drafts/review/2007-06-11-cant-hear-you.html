excerpt: |-
  I was out of pocket as they say last week.  I got an ear infection in both ears from the water on the coast.

  I couldn't hear people on the phone and had to have my assistant take over on a real estate transaction.  I implemented some time saving procedures while I was down.  I've had help for the last couple of years and got some additional help last week.

<p>I was out of pocket as they say last week.  I got an ear infection in both ears from the ocean or pool when on vacation the week before on the coast.</p>
<p>I couldn't hear people on the phone and had to have my assistant take over on a real estate transaction.  I implemented some time saving procedures while I was down.  I've had help for the last couple of years and got some additional help last week.</p>
<p>Business moved on while I enjoyed the silence.  I'm back to normal and keeping the updated system in place.  I got about the same amount done last week without being able to hear much of anything.</p>
<p>Stop occasionally and reevaluate how you do things.  Streamline it, get help and focus on what you love.  Outsource what you don't love.  The purpose of life is to have fun.  The successful people in life have fun and make money.  They go hand-in-hand.</p>
<p>Play Prosperity Games my new e-book is set to launch in a couple of weeks.  It provides a clear understandable approach to finding new business ideas based on what you love.  Successful people do what they love.  Unsuccessful people keep doing what they are doing hoping it will work out.</p>
<p>Do what you love and systemize.</p>
