<p>I've been depressed a few times in my life.</p>
<p>I believe Entrepreneurs have this problem more often than most because we push ourselves more than most. And not everything goes as planned.</p>
<p>At times I've had to watch quite a few YouTube videos on how to be happy. They have helped a great deal along with daily meditation and my morning routine. And learning not to care too much of what some others think.</p>
<p>I will purposely do things to become happy so that I can get back to my ideal day and be productive and live a life worth living.</p>
<p>Here are some of my favorite videos on how to be happy that I've collected over the years. Enjoy.</p>
