<p>Since I retired from working with a lot of clients and only partnering with very select people my business has changed a lot.</p>
<p>I use to market myself and help client after client on a consulting basis.</p>
<p>I flipped to just partnering. I only do anything if I own part of the company, period.</p>
<p>It was a good decision looking back.</p>
<p>But, it's been hard on my ego.</p>
<p>And as my businesses have grown I've had to outsource many things I've done for years. I've hired people that honestly are just better at some things than I am. And I have felt like I've disappeared from social media, blogging, hanging out with my marketing buddies. And it's true, I have.</p>
<p>In order to grow business to be real big I've had to let go of my ego. I've felt at times that I'm not useful, or even needed because I literally just hire and rarely fire people, I make decisions and tell my team to do it. I talk to people which I love and gotten out more to meet real people in person. I've gotten away from the computer a lot. And I use to be defined by how well I used a computer.</p>
<p>I don't even consider myself a marketer anymore, even though that is the heart of what I focus on. I hire the best to help in that, really anything.</p>
<p>But, I have to admit it's been hard. I liked being known and wanted. But, if I stayed at what I was doing and how I was doing it, I wouldn't have a business that supports me like it does now.</p>
<p>Would I do it again?</p>
<p>Yes I would.</p>
<p>I do better, I've learned more about what it really takes to be successful by focusing and owning part of the business.</p>
<p>But, I do miss the ego pumping days. But my overall happiness is more important. Being able to do what I want to and having a team support me is more important to me.</p>
