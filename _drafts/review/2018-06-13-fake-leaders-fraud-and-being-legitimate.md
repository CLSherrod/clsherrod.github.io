<p>I've seen a lot of posts calling out fake gurus lately.</p>
<p>Promising 10,000 fans <span class="aBn" tabindex="0" data-term="goog_431360622"><span class="aQJ">in 48 hours</span></span> or $1/leads.</p>
<p>Or take a guy's course and you'll be a social media guru overnight.</p>
<p>And it's completely fake.</p>
<p>But to a newbie, it doesn't sound fake.</p>
<p>In fact, it sounds awesome.</p>
<p>But that is because you can't see that their Facebook ad campaign targeted worldwide<br />
without any specific interests. Add a cute puppy picture of the cutest puppy ever and<br />
that gained them 10,000 fans <span class="aBn" tabindex="0" data-term="goog_431360623"><span class="aQJ">in 48 hours</span></span>.</p>
<p>Too bad the page isn't about puppies but some boring local business and now they have<br />
10,000 fake fans who could care less about you.</p>
<p>And then you realize that Facebook wants many thousands of dollars to show any post<br />
to your fan page fake audience.</p>
<p>I've made more money than some people with huge social media following.</p>
<p>They get on stage and everyone worships them and I live in the Caribbean and launch<br />
actual marketing and am much less popular.</p>
<p>I use this email to educate on what I'm actually seeing working.</p>
<p>Because I'm just interested in results. I don't have an ego about it. Just results.</p>
<p>I've tested many things and I only talk in my emails about what actually worked for me.</p>
<p>I try to keep it upbeat.</p>
<p>Podcasting worked for a client of mine. I wrote up a marketing sequence that has made<br />
her the best income this last month that she has had in years. She's also a great phone<br />
closer which helps a lot.</p>
<p>That's why I'm encouraging people to get involved in podcasting. It works if done right.</p>
<p>Will you be as popular as Kanye West.</p>
<p>Well no.</p>
<p>Will you be known in your niche?</p>
<p>Yes, yes you will.</p>
<p>Don't be concerned about how many fans you have but on how you are educating<br />
people about your niche, being a true leader and not a fake leader, getting respect<br />
for teaching the truth and helping people.</p>
<p>I've been blacklisted because I told someone how they were doing things was fraud.<br />
They got me kicked out of a mastermind. The leader wouldn't even talk to me so I could<br />
defend myself.</p>
<p>I didn't have a choice because the fraud was so great it was criminal and I didn't want<br />
to be involved in it.</p>
<p>I gave them the chance to make it right. They choose poorly. Their entire coaching<br />
business is built on fraud.</p>
<p>And they know it and are super protective of keeping that a secret.</p>
<p>That's their real secret to being successful.</p>
<p>But it's fraud.</p>
<p>So when I say this I have personal experience.</p>
<p>It wasn't fun being blacklisted.</p>
<p>But, I focused on doing legitimate business.</p>
<p>And I only recommend things I've personally seen work.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading.</p>
<p>I want you to be successful and I hope this type of email helps you.</p>
<p>You can be successful and do it ethically and legally.</p>
