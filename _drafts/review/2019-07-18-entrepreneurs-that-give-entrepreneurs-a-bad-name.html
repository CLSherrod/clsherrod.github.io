<p>I've long been an entrepreneur.</p>
<p>I started by selling smelly erasers in elementary school with my best friend Mark. Even though I spent my profits on keeping the best smelly erasers. I broke even, but it was worth it.</p>
<p>I got over smelly erasers and over the years sold tons of things, everything from services to physical goods, always with a brand name.</p>
<p>And with social media I, like you, have noticed a ton of entrepreneurs that come off like used car sales people.</p>
<p>People that are famous for being an entrepreneur even though they have no known business success.</p>
<p>Just famous for being famous.</p>
<p>Like this joke video I saw last night when I was watching comedy videos from YouTube. Have a watch and I think you will agree.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MhTDp5FwfmM" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>I was laughing out loud with this video. This guy really got what it looks like to me.</p>
<p>I've recently removed more connections to people that this video makes fun of.</p>
<p>I love real entrepreneurs but if I don't know that you've been successful at a real business then why should I listen to you?</p>
<p>I would rather be successful in business and be almost unknown as an entrepreneur than what this video makes fun of.</p>
<p>This has gotten so bad that this video was even conceived let alone done so well.</p>
<p>Even Robert Kiyosoki, the "Rich Dad, Poor Dad" author recently came out with a new book "FAKE: Fake Money, Fake Teachers, Fake Assets" that apparently (I haven't read it yet) goes into the huge trend of fake business coaches. A trend I saw many years ago and I've distanced myself from people like that.</p>
<p>These fake business coaches don't like it when you point out that it's uncool to go from virtual assistant to business coach. It feels like a con-job so they trash your name in order to protect themselves and I for one don't like playing the name calling game.</p>
<p>So I just talk to real talking entrepreneurs and avoid the ones that sound like this video.</p>
