<p><a href="http://www.thepassiontest.com/offer/home/?af=na" rel="nofollow"><img class="alignright" title="The Passion Test" src="http://www.thepassiontest.com/images/database/830.jpg" alt="" width="156" height="240" / rel="nofollow"/></a>Chris and Janet Attwood are probably the most knowledgeable, most impressive, and most practical experts I know on what it takes to discover and live your passions.</p>
<p>You may have heard me talk about their extraordinary book, The Passion Test. Within two weeks of its release in hardcover it was a New York Times bestseller.</p>
<p>The Passion Test is a tour de force--a fast track path to turn on and up the passion, the excitement, the success in your life--for you, your loved ones, your friends and  your associates. It has been used and recommended by some of the people I most respect . . . people like Jack Canfield, Jay Abraham, John Gray, Marci Shimoff, and Harv Eker.</p>
<p>The Passion Test has been lauded and used to profound and life changing value for so many thousands of people that we would be remiss if we didn't make this available to you.</p>

<p>But in addition, Plume, the publisher of The Passion Test, is releasing the paperback edition of The Passion Test today, on International Passion Day.</p>
<p>This day is a chance for each of us to reflect on how much richer and happier your life will be when you become more passionate, more stimulated, more turned on about your life, your relationships, your work, your possibilities.</p>
<p>Reflection is good, but Chris and Janet have set a high and laudatory goal which I hope we can help them achieve: to inspire at least five million people to take action to follow their passions and begin living their life purpose.</p>
<p>They are asking all of us: How can you follow your passions to serve another today?</p>
<p>To that end, Chris and Janet have gone to great effort and expense to create an eye-opening movie presentation to tantalize you and celebrate International Passion Day.</p>
<p>Go check out the promotion of The Passion Test. If you are so moved, then I urge you to get a copy of the book, and everyone reading this, whether you buy the book or not, if you trust my judgment and what I stand for, then please heed what I am about to say:</p>
<p>Take the time to review the wonderful promotion of the book, but then scroll down the page to "Passion Day Movie" and take four minutes to  watch this remarkable video presentation. It will inspire and uplift you, and it will also provoke you to think about where you are in your life, and where you could be.</p>

<p>Do you know what you are passionate about? Or are you like Jack Canfield, co-creator of Chicken Soup for the Soul who said:</p>
<p>""When I did the work on discovering your passion with Chris and Janet . . . I wasn't expecting that much to happen because I am already living my passion . . . However, their powerful process took me to an even deeper place, where I realized I was not spending enough time with my true number one passion -- my family! That realization,<br />
and the other work they did with me, has changed the way I have lived the past year."</p>
<p>Today is  International Passion Day. Take time to today to discover your passions and then take action to serve another.</p>
<p>Whether you think you know your passions or not, the best way I know to discover and renew them is with The Passion Test. Be sure to get your copy of the paperback today and get in on all the International Passion Day goodies.</p>

<p>Happy International Passion Day!!</p>
<p>With warmest wishes,</p>
<p>(Partner)</p>
<p>P.S. If you looked at the most successful and the happiest people on the planet today and asked "why are they so happy", or "why are they so rich?" or "how did they find such fulfillment," you would find one thing in common: they live with passion. Today is your chance to discover your passions, and then take action to use  them to serve others. Join the celebration of International Passion Day, get a copy of The Passion Test and together, let's make a real difference in the world!</p>
