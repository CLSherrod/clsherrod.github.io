<p>Earlier tonight I was interviewed by Nan Akasha about her recent book launch that went #1 in her targeted category on Amazon and how I helped make that all happen. Listen to it on <a href="http://loaradionetwork.com/nan-akasha.html" rel="nofollow">Law of Attraction Radio</a>.</p>
<p>Here is Nan's introduction</p>
<blockquote><p>I am pleased to have as my guest May 25th Christopher Sherrod from https://christopher-sherrod.blisslifepress.com/ If you are a business owner, author, coach, healer, or any entrepreneur… (actually even an employee wanting a new job or position) you need to understand the lifeblood of any business. Marketing and branding yourself… YOU are your #1 asset and commodity and you need to clearly create a powerful presence that stands above the crowd.</p>
<p>Join the show here: http://loaradionetwork.com/nan-akasha.html</p>
<p>Chris is not only an expert webmaster, marketing strategist and branding specialist, he also wrote the book “Play Prosperity Games” which guides you through games to help you create new business ideas based on what you love. He knows all about what it takes to create and grow a business online and create an online presence and message that stands above the crowd and attracts the ideal clients.</p>
<p>Chris was also a major part of the success of my recent book #1 bestseller “Already Rich! Secrets to Master Your Money Mind”. He formatted and did the graphics for the book, all the websites and even hired and trained a Virtual assistant for me. His skills, reliability and extensive experience and knowledge are invaluable!</p>
<p>Chris has been creating online businesses for 21 years, was on the team that launched American Express’ online presence and has been featured by Fox small business news, Be the media and in several books.</p>
<p>We will be sharing about how to create a successful launch of any product service or just you, as well as about Branding yourself and why it is the KEY to your success.</p>
<p>Chris has a free webinar called “The Secret to Increased Business Success: Stand out from the crowd. Brand Yourself online.”
