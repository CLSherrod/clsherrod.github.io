My favorite show as a teenager living in remote Alaska was, believe it or not, <a href="https://www.nbc.com/miami-vice?nbc=1">Miami Vice</a>.

I loved the style, the action and not to mention the weather.

I wanted to be Sonny Crocket. The clothes, the sailboat, the women, everything but the actual job he had.

And when I moved to Arizona at the end of high school I was finally able to find the clothes that looked like the show. (I couldn't find any cool clothes in Alaska in the 80's.)

I promptly bought an entire outfit including the shoes (no socks).

And that is probably why I lost my first job because I showed up looking like Sonny Crocket. Oh well, I looked awesome.

I even recorded each show on VHS tape (millennials r<span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">ead the </span><a style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VHS">Wikipedia article</a><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;"> on what a VHS tape is).</span>

I carried those VHS tapes with all my moves for the next twenty-something years. Finally selling them on Craigslist since I could get a digital stream and I was planning to travel around the world slowly.

And I was writing with a view of the Caribbean recently. This view in fact.

I wanted to live in the tropics where it never snowed. Where it was always summer.

And I have it.

That moment when you realize you fulfilled a dream you had as a kid has already happened is just fantastic.

Live the life you want.</p>
