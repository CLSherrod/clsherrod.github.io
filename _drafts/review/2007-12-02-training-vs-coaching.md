<p>I'm amazed by the number of people that provide coaching.  I'm also amazed because many of them are not even coaching.  They are training.  Big big difference.</p>
<p>Mark Joyner wrote an article that says it quite well.</p>
> Coaching can help, but there's a problem ...Unless you get direct access to a real - truly qualified - coach yourself, you're not really getting coaching.</p>
<p>Heck, I've seen people charge clients $8,000 for a year of coaching only to find that the clients call in for their coaching session and the coach pushes the "play" button on a recording.</p>
<p>Yikes.</p>
<p>Sorry, that ain't coaching. It's training.</p>
<p>(And usually sub-standard training at that, unfortunately. Few companies take the time to perfect step-by-step [and fun!] training systems like we build at Simpleology. It costs a lot more to do what we do, but after reading this series I'm sure you're beginning to understand why we take the effort.)</p>
<p>Oh, here's another one you may have seen ...</p>
<p>You buy coaching and you do, in fact, get a real live coach.</p>
<p>But ...</p>
<p>Your coach ends up being an unqualified kid who really doesn't know what he's doing. Such a coach could really wreak havoc on your business by sending you careening down the wrong path.</p>
<p>Simpleology could have cashed in on the coaching business a long time ago, but we chose not to. Quality and value are more important to us.</p>
<p>The fact is, someone who really knows how to build a multi-million dollar business simply can't afford to spend time coaching you personally, unless you're willing to pay them outrageous sums.</p>
<p>(I used to ask $2,000 an hour for phone consultations myself, but I don't even do that anymore because my time is worth more than that.)</p>
<p>Think about it - if someone could build million dollar businesses, why would they charge you $8,000-$20,000 to train you personally for a year?</p>
<p>"Error. Does not compute."</p>
<p>That's why the coaching is usually performed by recording, or by someone under-qualified. It's the only way to make the economic model work.</p></blockquote>
