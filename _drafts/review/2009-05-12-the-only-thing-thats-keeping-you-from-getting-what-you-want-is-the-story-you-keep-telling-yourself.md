<p>I didn't think I was good at public speaking.  I joined Toastmasters and did that for over a year until I got so comfortable with my group that I wasn't learning anymore.  If I know people I can easily speak out, doing that in front of a lot of strangers was another story.</p>
<p>So I started focusing on speaking in front of strangers.</p>
<p>Nan my girlfriend, encouraged me to just say what was on my mind.  "Let them see how wonderful you are" is a common quote from her to me.  So I started to be more expressive.  And it has worked.  I've spoken at several engagements and people are seeing me as very knowledgeable.  I've even gotten comments telling me I was the best speaker at a multiple speaker event.  This thrilled me.  I thank Nan for encouraging me into doing this.</p>
<p>Everyone should have someone in their life supporting and encouraging them.</p>
<p>But it comes down to you and your story in your own head.  I was reading this article a few moments ago:</p>
>“The only thing that’s keeping you from getting what you want is the story you keep telling yourself,” says Robbins. “What we can or cannot do, what we consider possible or impossible, is rarely a function of our true capability. It is more likely a function of our beliefs about who we are.”</p>
<p>Robbins is a firm believer in the power of the mind; the only way to go from good to great is to believe that it is possible. If we believe we are destined for small things, then that is all we will ever achieve. Conversely, if we believe we are destined for greatness, we will settle for nothing less and we will not stop until we have reached that goal.</p>
<p>“I’ve continued to recognize the power individuals have to change virtually anything and everything in their lives in an instant,” says Robbins. “I’ve learned that the resources we need to turn our dreams into reality are within us, merely waiting for the day when we decide to wake up and claim our birthright.”</p>
<p>According to Robbins, the single biggest reason why most people fail to achieve a fulfilling life is because they are stuck in the limits of their own mind; they settle for a quality of life that is below what they desire because they don’t think they can do better or they fear the possibility of failure. But, says Robbins, failing to challenge yourself is the greatest failure of all.  via <a href="http://www.youngentrepreneur.com/blog/2009/04/14/the-only-thing-thats-keeping-you-from-getting-what-you-want-is-the-story-you-keep-telling-yourself-anthony-robbins/" rel="nofollow">The Only Thing That’s Keeping You From Getting What You Want Is The Story You Keep Telling Yourself - Anthony Robbins</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>I use to believe I wasn't good as a speaker because I got a C in public speaking in college (my only C I have ever received).  I kept repeating that story until I got an interrupt from Nan who saw me talk for hours on end in a hot tub when I was relaxed.  She showed me that my story I had in my head was false.  That was then and right now I'm a completely different person  who totally enjoys interacting with people and showing them how to create new business ideas and then helping them implement them.</p>
<p>What false beliefs are holding you back?  What can you interrupt to get you on the path of your true greatness?</p>
