<p>I had a "bad" day yesterday.</p>
<p>I have a wonderful life and I had a down day.  Totally upstream from 1pm on.</p>
<p>Now my morning was fantastic.  Time with my lady Nan in bed, yes indeed, very fantastic.</p>
<p>But, then I got to work at 1pm.  I felt like I wasted half the day.  I felt like I  wasn't going fast enough with my current project.</p>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/posts/2008/02/beach-1.jpg" alt="Beach chairs" align="right" />Nan, went to the beach and I tried to work, but I couldn't think straight.  I felt overwhelmed.   So, I went to read a fiction fun book and then meditate.  It didn't work.  I was still pissed off and I didn't know what to do.  Going to the beach which I can see from our place was a totally upstream thought.  I felt that if I went to the beach I would just being a lazy person.</p>
<p>It wasn't until my mastermind call last night that I finally snapped out of it.  My mastermind group showed me that my life is fantastic.  Most people would be jealousy quite honestly.  And they showed me that the lifestyle that I want is not one of someone working all the time.  I look up to many successful people and some of them are really not for me.  Some work constantly.  One hundred hours a week, non stop.  I can't do that.  I need time to rest and think.  I need time to enjoy the pleasures of the world.</p>
<p>So I work when I'm inspired to do so.  Sometimes that is many hours in a week, more than most people work and sometimes it's not much like yesterday.  I worked for about one hour before going to the hot tub.  My mastermind group helped me change my to do list to something more reasonable to my lifestyle.</p>
<p>If you're not in a mastermind group then form one right now.</p>
<p>I'm off to the beach.</p>
