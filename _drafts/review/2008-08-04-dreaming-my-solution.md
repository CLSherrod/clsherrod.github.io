Last year I had a dream where I knew exactly how to create a product and it would take less than 2 hours for everything.

I woke up and did it first thing.Â  Very easy.

I get these dreaming solutions all the time.Â  I trust them and move forward based on them.Â  It always works out even if it seems it was a mistake at first.

I had this happen recently where I knew I had to fire a client.Â  We were just too incompatible to work together.Â  I was trying to find a solution but couldn't.Â  The dream solution was just to part ways.Â  A few days later that happened.Â  They went another way and I'm back to being happy working with clients that inspire me and where we both come out with cool stuff.

Be open to your solutions coming to you when you are your most relaxed, they are the best solutions.</p>
