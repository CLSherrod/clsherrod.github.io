<p>One of my favorite SciFi writers died Monday. She wrote stories that showed us how different things could be for us. “Light Hand To Darkness” was a major influence for me and highly recommended.</p>
<p>"Hard times are coming," she warned, "when we'll be wanting the voices of writers who can see alternatives to how we live now, can see through our fear-stricken society and its obsessive technologies to other ways of being, and even imagine real grounds for hope. We'll need writers who can remember freedom — poets, visionaries, realists of a larger reality."</p>
<p>RIP Ursula.</p>
