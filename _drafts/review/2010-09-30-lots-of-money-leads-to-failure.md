<p>Most of my clients that have quite a bit of money to invest in their online business lose it all before they come to me.</p>
<p>They have coaches that recommend they get everything right away. They recommend 1ShoppingCart at $100/mo, their own web server at $750+/mo, merchant account, etc.  They gladly do this thinking these are legitmate business expenses. They are but they didn't need them yet. The coach is pushing it because they make a nice affiliate commission off of all of it.</p>
<p>If you don't have a product or affiliates you don't need a shopping cart. And you may be better off using Paypal at first and progressing up based on the actual features you need. Once you need a hard core affiliate system then yes 1ShoppingCart maybe what you need, but probably not to start off with.</p>
<p>And dedicated hosting? Only very large clients need that. Basic hosting will do most at $7+/mo. And $50/mo handles almost everyone except for the multi-millionaires and they aren't spending much more.</p>
<p>Just keep in mind that you can upgrade at anytime on the Internet, new companies, new technology are coming out all the time and things are getting cheaper.</p>
<p>Use what works for you needs right now and progress when needed.</p>
<p>The clients that have a decent budget are the ones that are more successful. They get what they need done professional and quickly and have money to market.</p>
