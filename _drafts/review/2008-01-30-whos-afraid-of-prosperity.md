I use to listen to people that believed in a million conspiracies.  Some I know are true.  A vast majority are not I believe.  I saw these people become more and more broke.  If you made money you were hurting everyone and feeding the "system".  If you were broke it was good.  I never really understand their logic.

So when I started to focus on prosperity those people in my life faded away.  Now when ever I see them I can't believe I use to hang out with them.  How depressing they are.

Many people and even people that don't believe in conspiracies think that countries like China and India becoming 1st world countries will hurt us and the entire world.  John Stossel brings us an article about this illogical thinking.</p>
>...media handwringers suggest we should worry about the poor becoming rich.Actually, we shouldn't. It would be a sad world if one person's economic success depended on another's failure?

More of us would understand this if we learned what the great economics writer Henry Hazlitt preached in his classic book, "Economics in One Lesson": "The art of economics consists in looking not merely at the immediate but at the longer effects of any act or policy."

In the short run, richer Chinese and Indians bid up the prices of things. But that's just the beginning of the story. Increased demand and higher prices create opportunities for entrepreneurs.

When the price of, say, oil goes up, entrepreneurs and inventors have a strong incentive to: 1) find more, 2) find alternatives, and 3) find ways to use oil more efficiently. You and I cannot foresee what they will invent, but that means nothing. Predictions about the end of progress have been issued countless times. There is no reason to think they will be right this time.</p></blockquote>
