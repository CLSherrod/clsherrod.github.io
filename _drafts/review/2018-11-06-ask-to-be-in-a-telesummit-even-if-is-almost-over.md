<p>My love Akasha just finished recording a call for a telesummit that is almost done.</p>
<p>She saw it last week and asked to be in it right away.</p>
<p>It's almost never too late to join an ongoing event.</p>
<p>I've scheduled her for physical events the day before it started and telesummits<br />
when 19 of 20 speakers had already spoken.</p>
<p>Again, it's almost never too late.</p>
<p>Just ask.</p>
