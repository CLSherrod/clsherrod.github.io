<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/posts/2007/10/img_3173_edited-1.jpg" alt="Joe Vitale and Me" width="200" align="right" />I was out of town with my love <a href="http://www.createyourownrealitynow.com" rel="nofollow">Nan</a> and our friend Nat from England. I wanted to show Nat one of my favorite bookstores. I've been out of country and traveling alot so I hadn't seen Joe Vitale's book "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/zerolimits" rel="nofollow">Zero Limits</a>" yet and it was displayed at my favorite bookstore.</p>
<p>I suddenly remembered that I was in it. I quickly looked myself up in the book. I'm on page 101. It felt great seeing my story of how I found my love Nan in print for the world to read about. It's a great story and I thank Joe for writing letting everyone know about. I also thank Joe for coming out of the closet on his spiritual road. I love your marketing books and I love that you are sharing your spiritual journey. I also believe that they can coexist and in fact think they need to.</p>
<p>Nat in her most English way asked someone else in the bookstore to take a picture of herself with me discussing and holding the book. I felt great as Nat explains to this stranger that I'm in a book and that I'm fantastic. He seemed impressed. Heck, I was impressed after hearing her speech. :-)</p>
<p>Learn how to manifest your love of your life. Again, page 101.</p>
<p>All is love. And life is good.</p>
