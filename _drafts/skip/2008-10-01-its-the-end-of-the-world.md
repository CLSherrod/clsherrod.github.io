My friend Craig Perrine had an excellent post yesterday about the economic non end of the world.  Nice quote here.
>It’s the circle of economic life my friend, not a crisis or the end of the US as we know it (contrary to what all the uber ninnies on the news are telling us).

As you’ll see, the real question is: How do you put yourself in a position of strength to thrive in up and down times?</blockquote>
<p>I have another friend that has made more money in the last two weeks than the last two years.  It's all about changing your tactics depending on opportunity.

Richard Branson in his new book states that entrepreneurs must adapt.  Some tactics may not work for ever.  Adapt, adapt, adapt.  I just got Richard Branson's new book today.  Looking forward to reading it.  Plus I got the Virgin Messenger bag I won.  Nice.
