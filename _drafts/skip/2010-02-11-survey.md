I have a survey up where I'm asking you what you think I'm good at and  what I'm not. Please <a href="http://surveys.polldaddy.com/s/065C4C8F32A55CD1/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">go to my survey</a> and take a minute to share with me  what you think.

I would really <a href="http://surveys.polldaddy.com/s/065C4C8F32A55CD1/" rel="nofollow">appreciate your feedback</a>. It's anonymous so you can really tell me what you think. If giving negative feedback please give me a clue on how to make it better. I take constructive feedback very positively as I always want to be better and I'm human and am not perfect.

So<a href="http://surveys.polldaddy.com/s/065C4C8F32A55CD1/" rel="nofollow"> let me know</a>. Your input will directly influence what I do, so speak up and let me know.
