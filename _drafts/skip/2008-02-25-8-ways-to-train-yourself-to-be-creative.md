Here are some very creative ways to be creative and you don't even have to feel creative in order to do them.</p>
>To be creative, you have to first believe you are creative.

A short time ago I received an email from a young entrepreneur asking me how he was suppose to compete in a marketplace where the competition was high and more established companies had big advertising bucks. I mentioned a few ideas to him but the one that concerned him the most was creativity. Give him numbers and he'll work them, but tell him to come up with some creative idea, forget it.

He said he doesn't have a creative bone in his body.</p></blockquote>
