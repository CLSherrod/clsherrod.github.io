I get the question "Where's my stuff?" often. Many people think that once they start focusing on prosperity and abundance that it should instantly manifest. It can. Instantly. No doubt about it.
>Scientists estimate that the human brain thinks about 70,000 thoughts a day.If you multiply that by 365 days in a year, that's 25,550,000 thoughts. (I did that in my head.)

That, by the way, is twenty-five million, five hundred and fifty thousand thoughts.

Now, I want you to take your age and multiply it by twenty-five million, five hundred and fifty thousand.

The resulting number is the approximate number of thoughts you've had in your mind so far in your life.

For example, if you're 35, then you've had 894,250,000 thoughts. That's over 894 MILLION thoughts. Most of them unconscious.

So, now, let's say you decide in your 35th year, that you're going to add, I am peaceful and prosperous in every moment to the mix.

This can be likened (to use the words of a colorful ex-military man to whom I once had the pleasure of living next door) to farting at a hurricane. 

In other words, it might take longer than two weeks.</blockquote>
