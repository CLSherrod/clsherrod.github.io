Have you checked out <a href="http://www.youtube.com/montypython" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Monty Python’s YouTube</a> channel? It’s got a selection of their brilliant (as always) clips, and it’s got links to buy their DVDs on Amazon. As those crazy Monty Python dudes put it,

“We’re letting you see absolutely everything for free. So there! But we want something in return. None of your driveling, mindless comments. Instead, we want you to click on the links, buy our movies &amp; TV shows and soften our pain and disgust at being ripped off all these years.”

And you know what? Despite the entertainment industry’s constant cries about how bad they’re doing, it works. As we wrote yesterday, Monty Python’s <a href="http://mashable.com/2009/01/21/youtube-click-to-buy-overlay-ads/" rel="nofollow">DVDs climbed to No. 2 on Amazon’s Movies &amp; TV bestsellers list</a>, with increased sales of 23,000 percent.
