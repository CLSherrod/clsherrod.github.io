There are a lot of cool superpowers out there: invisibility, mastery of the elements, reading people’s thoughts...

But you know what?

Of all the dozens of superpowers we can think of or imagine, when asked this same question...

********************************<br />
Every millionaire and success master chose the same power!<br />
********************************

What is this one superpower that every wealthy and successful person agrees is the best?

More importantly, why do they believe this is a power YOU can possess?

********************************<br />
It's easier and more effective than you could possibly imagine.<br />
********************************

You see, the wealthiest, happiest, most successful people in the world have come clean about this power for centuries.

World-renowned internet marketing giants like Frank Kern, Willie Crawford, and Eben Pagan all possess and teach it.

So why haven't you discovered and used this incredible superpower yet?

********************************<br />
It's so simple, you've probably ignored it!<br />
********************************

Don't make that same mistake again. This isn't a gimmick to push some slick new money-making scheme, affiliate program, or software.

Actually, it couldn't be farther from it. You won't see a polished pitch in this video. In fact it's pretty un-polished if you ask me!

Just a conversation between John Assaraf and an underground insider, Harrison Klein.

But what they talk about will blow your mind.

********************************<br />
What if the greatest superpower in the world was one YOU could possess?<br />
********************************

You'll never know unless you check this video out:

If you haven't heard of John Assaraf, he is one of the most famous wealth and business experts in the world and was featured in the movie, "The Secret."

Listen to what he has to say, put it to work in your own life and business, and be sure to listen to the very end to find out how you can...

Weigh in with your favorite superpower!<br />

You'll also learn how to cultivate this superpower for FREE plus plenty more. It's an intense conversation, but you and I get to be flies on the wall.

<a href="http://www.TheMastersGathering.com/JohnAssaraf/?10355" rel="nofollow">WATCH THIS!</a> Then get ready for your life to change.

I mean, hey, if this is how the rich and successful people of the world are doing things, then that's all I need to know.

And I'll be honest: when I first watched this conversation, I was a bit freaked out. It's not what I was expecting. It's not marketing, it's not business, it's not even mindset.

It's that vital power that comes BEFORE all that. It's what makes all that stuff work.

Do me a favor though. Don't ignore it because it seems strange or easy. If you want the type of money, success, and life that millionaires like John Assaraf enjoy...

Well when in Rome...

DO AS THEY DO!

I know I am.

To your success,

Chris</p>
