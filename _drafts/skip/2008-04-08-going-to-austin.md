But, I wanted to tell you about where I'm off to next.  I'm attending the <a href="http://www.warriorevents.com/" rel="nofollow">Warrior Event</a> in Austin this Friday, Saturday and Sunday.

The Warrior Forum is the most famous gathering place online for Internet marketers to meet, trade ideas, and network.

I'll be hanging out with Craig Perrine the Maverick Marketer probably over a great bottle of wine and I'm going to dinner with Keith Wilke of Nitro Marketing.  Come along.

Hope you can make it.  Say hi.
