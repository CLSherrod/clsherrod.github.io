Apparently there is a lot of stories about the economy in the USA is slowing down and prosperity is disappearing. I say Apparently because I don't watch the negative news, I focus on the positive and look for opportunity everywhere.

This morning I'm reading my email and I have three tips in my inbox. All three show that prosperity and opportunity is abound.

<a href="http://www.greendaily.com/2008/02/04/green-by-the-numbers-future-of-green-jobs-offer-economic-prospe/" rel="nofollow">Green By The Numbers</a> show statistics that green related fields are very economically viable and growing in the future.  After decades of almost no growth the green industry is growing.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>In 2002, the solar industry market was worth $200 million dollars. In 2007, the estimated worth of the solar industry market was $2 billion dollars.</li>
<li>In 2005, the environmental industry created more than 5.3 million jobs in the US. Ten times more than the number of jobs created by the US pharmaceutical industry.</li>
<li>By 2030, the renewable energy and energy efficiency industries could create 40 million new jobs in the US.</li>
<li>In Europe, a 20 percent increase in energy efficiency is estimated to create a million new jobs.</li>
<li>Typically, <a href="http://www.greendaily.com/2007/12/28/green-collar-jobs-pay-more-than-a-living-wage-and-offer-job-sati/" rel="nofollow">green collar jobs pay four dollars more</a> than the living wage standard, provide health benefits, meaningful work, and occupational mobility.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://dealbook.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/02/01/branson-takes-to-greenroad/?hp" rel="nofollow">Branson Takes to GreenRoad</a> shows that new products are coming out that are fully centered on green and tech.</p>
>Clean-tech investors **Benchmark Capital** and Sir Richard Branson's **Virgin Green Fund** are wagering that rating a driver's performance can offer a profitable path to improved fuel economy and reduced accidents and carbon dioxide emissions.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://theairlineblog.blogspot.com/2008/02/branson-to-start-virgin-russia.html" rel="nofollow">Branson To Start Virgin Russia</a> also shows that traditional business still has room to grow within the world. This time to Russia where they really need a decent airline.</p>
>Billionaire Richard Branson has announced plans to start an airline in <st1 :country-region></st1><st1 :place>Russia</st1>, tentatively called Virgin Russia. He plans to take advantage of the oil-fueled Russian economy, which has given the average Russian more money (and an airline market that's growing at around 10 percent a year). "We hope to offer the Russian people a really good airline. We may be able to do it a little better than is being done at the moment," said Branson. "We're in discussion with two or three partners." Branson also noted that there are "150 million people here within a three-hour flight from <st1 :city></st1><st1 :place>Moscow</st1>."</p></blockquote>
<p>So see opportunity everywhere. See your prosperity growing. Look for opportunity. Seize the day and do it.</p>
