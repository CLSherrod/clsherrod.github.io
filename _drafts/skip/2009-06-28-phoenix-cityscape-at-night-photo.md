<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/eaglechris/1244757447/"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-14881" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/posts/2009/06/Phx-Night-Scape-300x192.jpg" alt="Phoenix Nightscape" width="300" height="192" /></a>I shot this many years ago, early to mid 90's.  It's a nice time exposure with my Nikon FM-2N camera, a totally manual 35mm camera.  I used a stopwatch and a time release cable to time the exposure just right. I bracket the exposures to get the right photo. I used a flashlight to light up the sign.</p>
