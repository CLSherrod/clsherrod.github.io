How do you feel about 2009? For most of us it holds a great deal of ambivalence. It promises to be a year of great positive change, yet lurking in the background is an element of fear. None of us want to hold onto the fear for we do not want to create a self-fulfilling prophecy. 2009 may therefore be the year for caution, but it can also be your year for great opportunities.

Many visionaries from the past have made great gains during times similar to these. And today's visionaries will repeat those success stories. I am writing to you today to share with you how you can make 2009 your best year ever, a year in which you can succeed beyond your wildest dreams.

Eldon Taylor, author of the New York Times best seller, Choices and Illusions, has made available to a very select group his "Essential Pillars of Success" at unheard of savings.  These principles have worked for thousands of people around the world, and are guaranteed to work for you. Essential Pillars of Success consists of nine programs on eight CDs, and comes with a book that explains how and why it is so easy to self-sabotage our best efforts, and provides a roadmap for correcting those thought patterns and beliefs. It also includes a booklet teaching the learning strategies involved in choosing the programs or 'scripts' that run through your mind. The entire mind conditioning set normally sells for $243.50 but it is yours today for only $88.00. Plus, you will receive hundreds of dollars in bonus tools to further assist you.

I have a bonus in this course.
