<p>Right after getting back from my meditation trip I got to rest a bit and then I was off to Progreso Yucatan Mexico and I'm going to Merida tomorrow.</p>
<p>I love visiting new places and connecting with local Expats.</p>
<p>I went to a local expat restaurant on Tuesday and had a great vegetarian salad which is a little hard to find around here.</p>
<p>Expat friendly places understand that expats want the best quality. You pay for it but it’s not much more. My salad cost $5 USD which is the most expensive salad in town because of the beach view. It’s the Arnold at the Milk Bar in Progreso across from<br />
the beach.</p>
<p>The waiter referred me to another restaurant, named Faces, which I went to the next day for lunch and I meet a ton of expats.</p>
<p>They were having a dart tournament and having fun yet somewhat serious time at it. The winner gets bragging rights for three days before the next game.</p>
<p>One expat Anna told me about a great breakfast place Barlovento just down from the Cruise Ship Pier. I just got back from eating there. Great vegetarians option and the vegan burger is on the secret menu btw.</p>

<p>And a cruise ship is in the dock today so a ton of tourists and vendors are out. I broke my last pair of sunglasses so I bought a pair walking back to my hotel.</p>
<p>Playa Linda Hotel here is nice and right on the beach. Very centrally located to everything.</p>

<p>I’ve also had lunch at several beach view restaurants and had a very relaxing time.</p>

<p>The expat lifestyle is perfect for me.</p>
<p>I get to travel as much or as little as I want.</p>
<p>I can have Expat friends and local friends as well.</p>
<p>I want to help show you the freedom of being an expat with a business and the lifestyle you can have right now.</p>
<p>The expat lifestyle is not a fantasy.</p>
<p>It’s real and it’s awesome.</p>
<p>In modern society, we are brainwashed with plans on what you have to accomplish in order to be happy.</p>
<p>When you let it go and do want you want the whole world opens up to you.</p>

<p>I want to help show you the freedom. It’s available to you and it’s waiting. Your Expat Life is not a fantasy or impossible to get to.</p>
<p>Join me next week after I get back from my little mini vacation to Progreso/Merida for how you can also have this lifestyle within 30 days. That’s what it took me to go from idea to having had moved.</p>
