<p>I'm very picky on business leaders I follow. Very picky.</p>
<p>Mostly because many have had no success in business and then say they are a business coach. Even some that go from virtual assistant to business coach and then wonder why you have an ethical issue with that.</p>
<p>So, that means I don't publicly say which business leaders I like.</p>
<p>I've written about my fondness of Richard Branson as being the best entrepreneur ever due to the sheer number of companies he has. He really does know what he is doing.</p>
<p>And I also like Seth Godin. I read his <a href="https://seths.blog">daily blog</a> and learn a lot.</p>
<p>Not nearly as many business compared to Richard Branson but he's had a few and knows what he's doing.</p>
<p>And I totally loved his <a href="https://tim.blog/2016/02/10/seth-godin/">two hour interview</a> that Tim Ferris had with him.</p>
<p>I just finished listening to it.</p>
<p>His comments about the difference between freelancer and entrepreneur are alone worth the listen (48:30 into the interview).</p>
<p>Plus, why he says no to so many opportunities (1:04:29 into the interview).</p>
<p>He has designed his life to what he wants and is an ethical marketer.</p>
<p>I'm not a big fan of long interviews but in this case it is well worth the two hours.</p>
