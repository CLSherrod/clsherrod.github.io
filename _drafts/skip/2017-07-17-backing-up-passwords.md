In the quest to never lose any data I store my data on the cloud.

Including my passwords.

So that at any moment if my laptop dies or is stolen I don't lose anything.

I'm on a Mac so I use Apple iCloud to get my documents backed up on the cloud. It's awesome.

But, I don't use Safari for web browsing. I use Chrome due to a ton of extensions I use that are only on Chrome.

And I don't want Google (the owner of Chrome web browser) to have my passwords stored. Sorry Google, you know too much.

So I use <a href="http://lastpass.com">Lastpass</a>. It's the #1 most preferred password manager

LastPass keeps your information private, secure, and hidden (even from them).

Everything is encrypted on the cloud at all times and only unencrypted and usable on your computer when you're logged in.</p>
