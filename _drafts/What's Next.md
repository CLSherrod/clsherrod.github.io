# **You Don’t Need to Know What You’re Doing With Your Life—Just What’s Next**  

## **The Pressure to Have It All Figured Out**  

Somewhere along the way, we were sold the idea that we need a **grand plan** for our lives. That we should have a clear vision, a five-year strategy, and a perfect roadmap to success.  

But life doesn’t work like that.  

Most of the time, we’re just figuring things out as we go. And that’s okay.  

## **No One Really Has It All Figured Out**  

Look around at the most successful people you admire. The ones who seem like they have everything together.  

Here’s a secret: **they’re making it up as they go, too.**  

Sure, they might have a general direction, but no one can predict exactly how their life will unfold. Careers shift, industries change, opportunities pop up out of nowhere. The best entrepreneurs, creators, and leaders didn’t know their full path in advance—they just kept taking the next step.  

## **Clarity Comes From Action, Not Thinking**  

A lot of people get stuck because they think they need a perfect plan before they start. They overanalyze, overthink, and wait for certainty.  

But real clarity doesn’t come from thinking—it comes from **doing**.  

Every time you take a step forward, you learn something new. You gain experience, meet new people, and discover what you like (or don’t like). Each step reveals the next one.  

So instead of asking, *“What am I doing with my life?”* try asking:  

- *What do I want to try next?*  
- *What small action can I take today?*  
- *What seems interesting or exciting right now?*  

## **Small Steps Lead to Big Discoveries**  

Most major life changes don’t happen overnight. They start with one small step.  

- You take on a side project, and it turns into a business.  
- You meet someone new, and they introduce you to an opportunity you never expected.  
- You try something different, and it sparks a passion you didn’t know you had.  

The key is to keep moving, even if you’re unsure where it will lead.  

## **Trust the Process**  

Life is a series of chapters, and you don’t need to know the whole book to turn the next page.  

Some of the best things that happen in life are **unplanned**. The detours, the unexpected opportunities, the risks that turn into something amazing.  

So stop stressing about the big picture. You don’t need to have it all figured out.  

Just take the next step.
