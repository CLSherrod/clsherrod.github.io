# Navigating Marketing Advice: What Really Matters

Marketing your own business—or a client’s—is all about continuous learning. It’s a journey where staying on top of the latest trends in marketing and PR is key. But with so much advice out there, it’s easy to feel overwhelmed. We’ve all seen those headlines that spark anxiety: “Worst Days to Post on Social Media,” “Never Pick Up the Phone When Pitching,” “Top 5 Things Journalists Don’t Want in a Pitch,” and so on.

These days, everyone online seems to have an opinion. But the truth is, not all advice is created equal. As a savvy marketer, it’s crucial to filter out what really applies to your unique situation.

Take social media posting, for example. Every other day, there’s a new article about the best times to post, based on surveys of thousands of businesses. But these often conflict with each other. One recent HubSpot article said that Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays are the best days to post. But what if your business, like a restaurant, thrives on weekends? Posting early on Saturday might actually work better for you when your audience is planning their weekend.

Another example is pitching journalists. We came across an article advising never to pick up the phone when pitching. “Never” is a strong word, and in our experience, it’s not always true. Building relationships with journalists often means making a call. Especially in local media, a follow-up phone call after sending a press release can be the difference between getting coverage and being ignored. News directors have even thanked us for the reminder.

The key takeaway? Expert advice is useful, but you need to decide what actually fits your business.

## How to Be Smart About Marketing Advice

**Trust Your Data:** Don’t let someone else’s data override your own. Your social media platforms and analytics tools can tell you when your audience is most engaged. Google Analytics can show you what blog lengths get the best results. Your data is gold—use it to guide your strategy.

**Value Your Experience:** If you’ve been in the game for a while, trust your gut. You know what works for your business or client. If calling certain media contacts has worked for you, keep doing it, no matter what the so-called experts say. Your experience is an asset.

**Recognize Your Uniqueness:** What works for one business might not work for another. A company selling insurance to tech startups has a very different audience from a dog toy retailer. The insurance company might do well with long, detailed blog posts, while the dog toy business might see better results with short, fun content. Tailor your approach to your audience.

**Consider the Source:** Think about who’s giving the advice and whether you trust them. Bad advice can hurt your business. Make sure you’re following guidance that makes sense for your situation. Look for insights from people who have proven success in the industry. And always question whether there might be hidden motives behind their advice.

## Rely on Data, Not Generic Advice

We’ve mentioned how your data is more valuable than generic advice, but it’s worth diving deeper. Data, metrics, and measurement are the bedrock of effective marketing and PR. Data gives you clarity and leaves little room for doubt.

Data helps answer key questions: Should your Facebook posts be longer or shorter? A/B test and see what the numbers say. Are your media pitches working? Look at the success rate across different pitches. Should your YouTube videos be 10 minutes or 20? Check the watch time data.

While industry advice can be helpful, always filter it through the lens of your data. Use it as a tool to shape strategies that fit your specific needs. In the end, the success of your marketing efforts depends on how well you tailor your strategies to what works best for you.
