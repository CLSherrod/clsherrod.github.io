<p>I was <a href="https://ahackersday.com/interviews/chris-sherrod-from-blisslifepress/">interviewed for A Hacker's Day about my morning routine</a>.</p>
<p>I've read a lot of books on successful morning routines.</p>
<p>Bought and consumed quickly Tony Robbins course "RPM Life Planner".</p>
<p>I read "Daily Routine Makeover" by Zoe McKey and "Manage Your Day To Day: Build Your Routine, Find Your Focus &amp; Sharpener Your Creative Mind" by Behance's 99U. And even the behemoth "Tools for Titans" By Tim Ferris.</p>
<p>My morning routine came out of applying these resources and adapting it to me and throwing out elements that didn't work for me.</p>
<p>My morning routine movie which I update every month with my goals and gratitude of my life is one of most important parts.</p>
<p>And in this exclusive interview I reveal all the apps I use in my morning routine and how I handle interruptions.</p>
<p>Many years of refining what I like my morning routine to be has lead to this. Hope you get an a-ha from reading it.</p>
<p>All the details are in my interview on <a href="https://ahackersday.com/interviews/chris-sherrod-from-blisslifepress/">A Hacker's Day</a>.</p>
