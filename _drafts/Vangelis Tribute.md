# Vangelis Tribute

## Summary
My tribute to Vangelis

## Title
The Soundtrack That Changed My Life: What Vangelis Taught Me About Legacy

## Essay
## The Power of a Single Note

You ever hear a song that stops you in your tracks? One that hits you so deeply, it feels like it rewires something inside? That’s what happened the first time I listened to Vangelis.

He wasn’t just background noise for me. His music was a lifeline. A mood shifter. A way to reset when the weight of building businesses, handling life, and chasing goals felt like too much. It was like he understood what I needed before I did.

## Music as a Tool, Not Just Entertainment

My favorite album of his—_Antarctica_—became my personal chill-out button. Whenever things got loud in my head, I’d put it on, lean back, and let the ice-cold clarity of those melodies bring me back to center.

Vangelis didn’t make music for the charts. He made music that touched the soul. His _Blade Runner_ soundtrack became my go-to reading companion in the living room, transporting me to another world while I explored new ideas on the page.

_Direct_ was another gem. The way the sounds danced and spoke to each other… it reminded me of a well-run business—each part working in harmony, nothing wasted.

And of course, _Chariots of Fire_. I’d blast that one and jog slowly around my kitchen island, pretending I was training for something big. Maybe I was. Maybe we all are.

## When a Hero Passes

When I found out Vangelis passed away in Paris, I expected to feel crushed. For years, I wondered how I’d react when that moment came.

But something surprising happened—I didn’t feel sadness.

Instead, I felt grateful. Deeply grateful.

He left behind a legacy. Dozens of albums. Countless tracks. A body of work that changed lives—including mine. And that’s the real goal, isn’t it? To leave something behind that matters.

## What Vangelis Taught Me About Legacy

I’ve built businesses, launched products, and helped others do the same. But if there’s one lesson Vangelis drilled into my soul, it’s this:

**Your legacy isn’t in what you accumulate—it’s in what you leave behind that still speaks when you’re gone.**

He didn’t chase fame. He chased meaning. And in doing so, he created timeless work that continues to lift people up.

That’s what I want. That’s what I think we all want, whether we’re making music, building a brand, or just showing up for people we love.

## Final Thoughts from a Grateful Fan

I’ll still put on _Antarctica_ when I need a reset. I’ll still jog around the kitchen to _Chariots of Fire_ when the day’s dragging. And I’ll always be thankful that one man, sitting in a studio somewhere, decided to make something real.

Thank you, Vangelis. From a super fan. You changed my life.

### Subject Line
The Soundtrack That Changed My Life 🎶 (and 7 Readers Said Yes)
### Body
I just published something close to my heart:

“The Soundtrack That Changed My Life: What Vangelis Taught Me About Legacy.” You can read it here: 👉 [https://christophersherrod.com/vangelis/](https://christophersherrod.com/vangelis/)

Vangelis—best known for the music of Blade Runner and Chariots of Fire—was more than a composer to me. His sound shaped how I create, how I feel space and silence, and how I think about what we leave behind. His work helped me understand that legacy isn’t about fame. It’s about depth, devotion, and resonance.

I’ve listened to his music for decades, often while creating my own. This tribute is my thank-you.

Also… a quick update:

Seven kind and curious souls have signed up to be advanced readers of my Reducing EMF Exposure Checklist. That means seven fresh perspectives to help me make it clearer, more useful, and better for everyone navigating tech overload.

I’m grateful.

This checklist—and the Unplugged book it connects to—isn’t just about escaping screens. It’s about tuning back into life. Into nature, relationships, presence. Like the kind of presence I feel when listening to music that moves me.

Thanks for being here,

Christopher

**P.S**. If you’d like to preview the EMF checklist before it’s released—and help make it even better—just reply to this email and I’ll send it your way.
