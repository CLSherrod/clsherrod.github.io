# **Stay in Your Lane: Why Expertise Matters More Than Opinions**

Not too long ago, I was watching an interview with a famous actor—someone who’s great at what they do. But instead of talking about their craft, they were going on and on about economics, politics, and the meaning of life, as if they had all the answers. 

And all I could think was: *Why should I listen to this person?*  

Now, don’t get me wrong—I respect talent. I respect hard work. But just because someone is great at one thing doesn’t mean they’re an expert on everything. And yet, in today’s world, people hang on every word celebrities, influencers, and business moguls say, no matter how far outside their expertise it is.  

## **Expertise Is Earned, Not Assumed**  

One of the biggest lessons I’ve learned in life is to trust experience over opinion. I built businesses. I made mistakes. I learned from them. And when I give advice on entrepreneurship, it’s because I’ve been in the trenches.  

But if you asked me how to perform brain surgery or design a spaceship, I’d tell you straight up: *I have no clue*. Because that’s not my lane.  

Too many people today confuse fame with wisdom. Just because someone has a platform doesn’t mean they know what they’re talking about. And the more we listen to unqualified voices, the more we lose sight of what really matters—genuine expertise.  

## **Why It’s Okay to Ignore the Noise**  

It’s easy to get caught up in the opinions of the rich and famous. Social media makes it seem like everyone has something important to say. But here’s the truth: *most of it doesn’t matter*.  

I’ve seen too many people waste energy arguing about a celebrity’s opinion or debating whether some billionaire is a genius or just lucky. None of that helps you build your own life. None of it makes you better at what you do.  

If you want to grow, stop looking up to people just because they’re famous. Instead, find mentors who actually know their craft. Learn from people who have *real* experience, not just a microphone and an audience.  

## **The Best Thing You Can Do: Focus on Your Own Skills**  

If there’s one piece of advice I’d give, it’s this: *become so good at what you do that people seek you out for your expertise.*  

Instead of worrying about what celebrities think, spend that energy improving yourself. Hone your skills. Build something worthwhile. And when the time comes, speak on what you actually know.  

Because the loudest voices aren’t always the wisest. And the people who truly make an impact? They’re the ones who put in the work, stay in their lane, and let their results do the talking.
