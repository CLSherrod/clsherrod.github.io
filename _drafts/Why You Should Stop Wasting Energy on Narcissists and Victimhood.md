# Why You Should Stop Wasting Energy on Narcissists and Victimhood

Ever had a conversation with someone who just *had* to be right? No matter what you said, no matter how logical your argument, they twisted things to fit their narrative. Exhausting, isn’t it?  

I’ve dealt with plenty of people like that—narcissists who believe their way is the only way, and victims who cling to their suffering like a security blanket. And here’s what I’ve learned: **neither mindset leads to anything good.**  

## **I’ve Been on Both Sides**  

I’ve been called a narcissist before. And honestly? At one point in my life, maybe I was. I thought I had all the answers. I dismissed people who disagreed with me. I saw my way as the *right* way. And the truth is, that kind of thinking cost me. It pushed away good people and made life harder than it needed to be.  

On the flip side, I’ve also felt like the victim of a narcissist. I had someone in my life who controlled every conversation, dismissed my concerns, and twisted reality to make me question myself. I wasted a couple hours trying to reason with them, hoping they’d change. But they never did.  

That’s when it hit me—whether you’re acting like the narcissist or playing the victim, you’re stuck in a cycle that keeps you from growing.  

## **Narcissists Don’t Want a Conversation—They Want Control**  

I once had a business partner who was convinced he was always the smartest person in the room. If you challenged him, even with facts, he’d either dismiss you or turn it into a personal attack. It didn’t matter if the business was at stake—his ego came first.  

At first, I tried reasoning with him. I thought, *If I just explain things the right way, he’ll understand.* But I was wrong. Narcissists don’t listen because they’re not interested in understanding—they’re interested in control.  

The best move I ever made was walking away. No drama, no fight. Just *done*. Because arguing with a narcissist is like wrestling a pig—you both get dirty, but the pig enjoys it.  

## **Victimhood Is a Trap, Not an Identity**  

On the other side of the coin, I’ve met plenty of people who were *always* the victim. Nothing was ever their fault—bad bosses, toxic relationships, the “system” keeping them down. And sure, sometimes life *is* unfair. But staying stuck in that mindset doesn’t fix anything.  

I had a friend who constantly complained about his terrible job. For *years*, he’d tell me how unfair his boss was, how underpaid he felt, and how he wished things were different. But every time I suggested looking for a new job or starting a side business, he’d have an excuse.  

Eventually, I realized—he didn’t want a solution. He wanted sympathy. And I wasn’t going to keep feeding that cycle.  

## **The Simple Truth: Just Walk Away**  

Here’s the biggest lesson I’ve learned: **some people just aren’t worth your energy.**  

Narcissists thrive on control. Victims thrive on pity. Neither will change unless *they* decide to. And in the meantime, you’re wasting precious time trying to fix something that isn’t yours to fix.  

If someone in your life constantly drains you—whether they’re self-obsessed or stuck in a cycle of complaining—walk away. Focus on people who actually listen, support, and challenge you in a healthy way.  

At the end of the day, life is too short to spend it arguing with someone who refuses to hear you. So stop trying to change people who don’t want to change. Instead, put your energy where it actually matters—on *your own* growth, happiness, and success.
