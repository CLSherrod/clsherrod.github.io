Sooo many scams that claim to be “digital marketing”

Honestly it pisses me off to see random girl bosses on Tiktok claim to make more money than their brain surgeon husbands with their “digital marketing” business. 

1. It’s offensive to people who actually studied and have experience in marketing 
2. It’s literally just a pyramid scheme, posting your scam online is not digital marketing!!!! 

Also just in general people stick “marketing” onto all types of sketchy jobs and courses. As an upcoming graduate, I’m always coming across some super horrible and misleading “marketing” jobs. I know many people that have joined pyramid schemes (MLMs) thinking they will get valuable marketing experience.
