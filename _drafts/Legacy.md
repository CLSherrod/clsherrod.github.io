# Your Legacy Isn't What You Leave Behind -- It's What You Leave in Others

## What They Remember When You're Gone

I was talking to someone who had just come from a funeral.

A close friend of theirs had passed unexpectedly.

They said something that stuck with me:  

> "Nobody talked about what he did for work. Not once."

No talk of portfolios, promotions, or accomplishments.

What they remembered--what cracked their voices and filled the room with tears--was how he made them feel.

I've noticed from my tribute essays that what was remembered about each of them is what they left behind. A book, an album, an idea. But, it wasn't the book or music so much as how it made people feel.  

That's legacy.

Not the stuff we accumulate, but the warmth we leave in others.

## The Trap of Measurable Success

We spend so much time chasing things that look good on paper.

Salary. Status. Metrics.

All those numbers we think prove we're doing something right.

But those things don't get mentioned when we're gone.

Your job title won't hug your spouse.

Your follower count won't check in on your best friend.

## What Actually Lasts

It's the small stuff.

The time you sat and listened.

The quiet encouragement.

The way you helped when no one asked.

Those are the things people carry.

They don't fade.

They deepen.

People remember how you showed up.

How you made them feel safe, seen, and cared for.

## You're Already Building It

Whether you mean to or not, you're already shaping your legacy.

Every interaction leaves something behind.

A tone.

A look.

A kindness.

Legacy isn't a grand gesture at the end.

It's dozens of small ones along the way.

## Why I Write These

I used to focus on building businesses.

Systems, strategy, growth--things that make sense on spreadsheets.

But what stuck with people wasn't the business advice.

It was the feeling that I understood them. That they were heard.

That's why I write these essays now.

To leave something deeper.

Not just for clients, but for loved ones too.

To say:

Live like how you treat people matters. Because it does.

## What Will They Say About You?

They won't talk about your resume.

They'll talk about your presence.

How you made them laugh.

How you helped them through something hard.

How you treated them when no one else was looking.

That's legacy.

And we shape it every single day.
