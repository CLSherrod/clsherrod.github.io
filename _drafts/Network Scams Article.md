Rewrite.

A scam typically involves a transaction, where a lie leads the buyer to believe something that, ultimately, results in loss. It's akin to buying magic beans that never sprout.

In the contemporary landscape, scams often exhibit a network component. Certain conditions, such as media amplification, make scams more likely. Alternatively, in cases like Ponzi schemes, individuals may sense deception but engage, thinking they can pass the risk to the next participant and come out ahead.

Participating in a network scam, as seen with NFT purchases based solely on speculative value rather than utility, relies on a collective belief for its success. Without a community sharing this belief, the scam wouldn't function.

Consider climate denial, which could be likened to a network scam. Those benefiting from activities like oil pumping or selling cheap disposable fashion thrive because others share a short-term outlook. Eventually, the illusion fades, leaving everyone grappling with the consequences.

In an ideal world, we'd recognize network scams early and intervene. Unfortunately, as Swartz notes, some adopt the mindset of a hustler: 'If it's a Ponzi, get in early.'
