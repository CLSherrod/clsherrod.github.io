# **Harsh Truths to Wake You Up Before You Waste Your Life**  

If you're chasing the dream of entrepreneurship, let me save you some time: most of what you’ve been told is BS. The indie hacker world, startup hype, and productivity influencers are all selling you a dream that rarely works out.  

You need **money**, not just validation from other founders. And you need to learn how to **sell**, not just build. Here are some harsh truths to get you disillusioned before you waste years chasing the wrong things.  

## **1. Product Hunt Is an Ego Play, Not a Business Strategy**  
Launching on Product Hunt might get you some likes, but it won’t get you customers. It’s mostly other founders patting each other on the back. If you need validation that badly, go to the gym and impress yourself instead.  

## **2. Building an Audience Doesn’t Mean Making Money**  
Your mom might love your tweets, but that doesn’t mean you’re running a business. Followers don’t automatically turn into customers. Unless you're selling something they actually need, your "audience-building" efforts are just entertainment.  

## **3. Indie Hackers Are Not Your Target Market**  
Selling to indie hackers means selling to people who are broke and hesitant to spend money. You need **buyers**—people with actual budgets. Fish where the fish are.  

## **4. Real Entrepreneurs Don’t Live on X/Twitter**  
You’ve been sold a fantasy about what "entrepreneurship" means. Most successful business owners don’t even have social media accounts. They’re too busy making money in **boring, profitable businesses** to tweet about it.  

## **5. Building Before Selling Is a Massive Waste of Time**  
If you build a product before confirming people will buy it, you’re just playing business. You might as well be playing video games—it’s the same level of productivity. Sell first, then build.  

## **6. Your Inner Nerd Won’t Make You Rich**  
You love coding, tinkering, and optimizing? That’s great—if your goal is to **stay broke**. If you actually want to make money, learn how to sell. You can always nerd out on the side.  

## **7. Your First Business Should Be a Proven Model**  
Startups are risky. If it’s your first business, don’t try to invent something new—**copy what’s already working** and do it better. Compete on **hunger**, not innovation.  

## **8. $5M Changes Your Life, Not a “Big Idea”**  
If you’re still broke, forget about revolutionizing the world. Your first goal should be to make a full-time income for you in a simple, proven business. Once you have money, *then* you can chase big swings to become wealthy if your ego still needs it.  

## **9. X/Twitter "Success Stories" Are Mostly Lies**  
Most people who "made it" on social media are exaggerating their numbers or flat-out lying. One good month of revenue doesn’t mean you have a real business.  

## **10. Three Attempts Is Nothing—Try Dozens**  
You failed three times? Big deal. Most successful entrepreneurs have dozens of failures before something sticks. Keep going or accept that business isn’t for you.  

### **Final Thought: Stop Playing, Start Selling**  
If you take away one thing, let it be this: **sell something people already pay for.** Don’t chase hype. Don’t build before selling. Don’t waste time on validation from strangers.  

Make money first. Everything else comes after.
