## Title
Maximizing Assistant Efficiency: From Hiring to Delegation - 3 Common Problems and 10 Practical Tips
## Subtitle
Discover The Most Common Problems and implement 10 practical tips to effectively utilize your personal assistant, freeing up your time and reclaiming control as you expand your company.
## Article
Entrepreneurs and business leaders new to working with executive assistants often grapple with uncertainty on how to effectively delegate tasks. The common advice revolves around crafting intricate, detailed systems for assistants to follow.

However, the emphasis on systematization may overlook a fundamental aspect — the importance of hiring highly talented assistants from the outset. Instead of relying solely on complex systems, the key lies in recruiting top-notch assistants who can contribute meaningfully without the need for overly detailed instructions.

I've discovered that prioritizing the hiring of exceptional talent renders the creation of intricate Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) unnecessary. By sharing fundamental preferences and app logins, your assistant can autonomously develop efficient systems over time.

This approach not only offers various benefits, as elaborated below, but also saves you considerable time and effort that would otherwise be spent on crafting and tailoring complex systems.

This article outlines effective strategies for collaborating with executive assistants.
## 3 Challenges of Relying on Predefined Systems for Your Assistant
In my discussions with numerous entrepreneurs seeking assistant support, it's evident that each entrepreneur is unique, with distinct needs, preferences, and workflows in managing their business.

**The initial challenge with predefined systems is their one-size-fits-all nature.** Entrepreneurs often spend substantial time customizing these systems to align with their workflows, which can be more labor-intensive than building a system from scratch.

**Secondly, these step-by-step systems can restrict a great assistant's contributions.** They stifle creativity, growth, and autonomy—qualities valued by exceptional talent. Moreover, they limit an assistant's ability to devise even more efficient systems.

**Lastly, relying on predetermined systems establishes a precedent for your assistant.** The expectation becomes a perpetual reliance on detailed instructions. When expanding their responsibilities, you're expected to create specific guidelines. This hampers the development of a smart, autonomous assistant capable of handling new tasks without exhaustive guidance.

Our advice is to prioritize hiring outstanding talent initially. When hiring for the right qualities, micromanagement becomes minimal, and assistants become more adept at taking on new challenges independently. Over time, this boosts the value they deliver, yielding returns exceeding the initial investment.

Now, let's explore how to effectively onboard your assistant without resorting to overly complex systems.
## Starting Your Journey with Your Assistant
To kickstart collaboration with your assistant, adopt a straightforward approach:

1. **Select Initial Tasks:** Choose tasks to delegate, such as email and calendar management, filing expense reports, drafting memos, or handling personal tasks like online purchases and travel bookings.
    
2. **Provide Basic Information and Preferences:** Furnish your assistant with essential personal information and relevant preferences for task completion. Grant access to business-related platforms through a secure password manager for added security.
## Delegating Email Management
For delegating email responsibilities:

1. **Grant Access:** Provide your assistant with delegated email account access.
2. **Orientation:** Familiarize your assistant with your recent emails, emphasizing your approach to responses.  
3. **Preference Discussion:** Engage in a conversation about your ideal inbox—what you wish to see daily, priority types of messages, and those to discard.

Remember, fully delegating email is a gradual process. Begin with basic organization and allow it to evolve based on your preferences.
## Delegating Scheduling
For scheduling delegation:

1. **Provide Calendar Access:** Grant your assistant access to your calendar.
2. **Orientation:** Let them review your past schedules to understand your typical day.
3. **Discussion:** Discuss your goals, ideal day, and week to provide a clear picture for scheduling.

Empower your assistant to manage details once they grasp your expectations. Encourage them to take care of the operational aspects, allowing you to focus on core tasks.

While starting with routine tasks is practical, there's no need to confine assistants to administrative roles. Challenge them with progressively complex projects. In our experience with high-quality talent, assistants spend only about 30% of their time on basic administrative duties. The remainder is dedicated to diverse and valuable business projects.

Our clients have witnessed assistants managing an extensive range of tasks, including social media management, research, business writing, marketing support, design, and even human resource management.

Beyond these initial steps, allow the relationship with your assistant to naturally evolve. Most founders prefer a dynamic relationship where they can work with smart individuals without the need for task-specific templates. This natural progression fosters a collaborative environment where assistants contribute effectively with minimal guidance.
## 10 Delegation Tips
If you've ever felt overwhelmed with a plethora of projects, questioning whether delegating tasks to an assistant is genuinely helpful or just an additional burden, these 10 tips are designed for you.

Acknowledging the dual sentiment of needing assistance while grappling with the effort of training, here are practical insights to enhance your efficiency and make the most of your personal assistant's support, ensuring you achieve more in less time.

1. **Centralized Project List:** Maintain a single, comprehensive project list managed by your assistant to ensure nothing falls through the cracks.

Use Trello board Akasha Projects. Add current items to Active column and your Monday and daily items to Recurring.

-- Active Projects

-- Archived Projects (ones that are completed)

-- Recurring Projects (tasks that happen over and over again each day, week, or month)

The project list has the following columns:

- Priority (1,2,3): The rule being, _"Never do a 3 when you have uncompleted 2's; never do a 2 when you have uncompleted 1's you could work on."_
- Project / Task : This is what you've asked your assistant to do.
- Date Assigned
- Date Due
- Status (color) - Now, Next, Low
- 
2. **Excel Spreadsheet for Deliverables:** Avoid managing deliverables via email; use an Excel spreadsheet owned by your assistant for clear organization.
    
3. **Tab Structure for Organization:** Employ three tabs—Active Projects, Archived Projects, and Recurring Projects—on the project list for efficient tracking.
    
4. **Priority-Based System:** Assign priorities (1, 2, 3) to tasks, ensuring focused attention on high-priority items first.
    
5. **Record Delegation Meetings:** Capture key details by recording weekly delegation meetings for later review, promoting effective communication.
    
6. **Organized Capture System:** Utilize email categories, a desk file, and a written assistant delegation list to efficiently capture tasks and projects.
    
7. **Inbox Filtering:** Trust and train your assistant to filter your inbox, saving significant time by screening emails before reaching you.
    
8. **Assistant Handled Subfolder:** Establish a folder for emails your assistant has handled, allowing quick review and continuous improvement.
    
9. **Private Email Management:** If needed, set up a second email account for private matters, emphasizing the importance of confidentiality.
    
10. **Tech Support Oversight:** Delegate tech support responsibilities to your assistant, freeing you from the need to supervise IT tasks.
    
**Bonus Tip: Develop a System for Great Assistance:** Make it a priority for your assistant to create a comprehensive system for effective assistance, fostering continuous improvement and preparing for future hires.
