# The Biggest Misconception About Success (It’s Not What You Think!)  

## **SEO Title:** The Biggest Myth About Success (And Why It’s Holding You Back)  

Let me share something that might ruffle some feathers—the biggest misconception isn’t about business at all. It’s about **success**!  

## The Harsh Truth About Success and Entrepreneurship  

After years of entrepreneurship, I’ve realized something: Most people think success comes from having the best idea or the most money. But if that were true, why do so many "perfect" business ideas fail while seemingly "basic" businesses thrive?  

The biggest myth? **Success is a straight line up.**  

Ha! My journey has looked more like a heart monitor during a horror movie—ups, downs, flat lines, and sudden spikes. When I lost my daughter, went through bankruptcy, and had to rebuild, there was nothing “straight line” about it.  

## The #1 Misconception Keeping You Stuck  

Here’s what nobody talks about: **You don’t need to have it all figured out before you start.**  

When I launched my podcast and coaching business, I didn’t have the perfect plan—I just knew I wanted to help parent entrepreneurs avoid the mistakes I made. And that’s the key: **Starting before you feel ready.**  

## 3 Myths About Success That Need Busting  

1. **"Overnight success is real."** Nope! Those so-called “overnight successes” you see? They usually have 5–10 years of grinding behind the scenes.  

2. **"You need a lot of money to start."** Some of the most successful businesses started with almost nothing. What you actually need is problem-solving ability and persistence.  

3. **"If you build it, they will come."** The biggest shock for new entrepreneurs? Making something great is only half the battle. Marketing and sales matter just as much as your product or service.  

## The Truth About Success: It’s the Opposite of What You Think  

Want to know the craziest part? **Success comes from doing the exact opposite of what most people believe.**  

- It’s not about being perfect—it’s about being **persistent**.  
- It’s not about avoiding failures—it’s about **failing faster and learning from each one**.  
- It’s not about following some perfect blueprint—it’s about **solving problems and creating value while staying true to who you are**.  

## What Misconceptions Did You Have About Success?  

Think back to when you started—what did you believe about success that turned out to be completely wrong? Share your thoughts! 💪
