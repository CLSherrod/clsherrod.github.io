# **Stop Watching Hustle Porn—It’s Making You Miserable**  

## **The Toxic Trap of Hustle Culture**  

Can we all just take a deep breath and **stop consuming this toxic hustle porn?**  

## **Success Isn’t a Straight Line**  

Let me be real with you—I failed **a lot.**  

I started businesses that crashed and burned. I had nights where I stared at the ceiling, convinced I was a failure.  

It’s different for **everyone.**  

You are not behind. You are not a failure because some 19-year-old on Twitter flexes about buying a Lamborghini with his crypto gains.  

## **Why Are You Really Doing This?**  

Somewhere along the way, it feels like we all forgot **why** we wanted to build businesses in the first place.  

To solve problems.  
To create something cool.  
To enjoy the process.  

Now? It seems like people think they have to **flex their success on Instagram** just to feel validated.  

Do people not build businesses for fun anymore?  

## **Stop Measuring Your Worth in Dollar Signs**  

If your happiness is tied to hitting $25K MRR, guess what? When you hit it, you’ll just move the goalpost.  

You’ll want $50K.  
Then $100K.  
Then $1M.  

And if you don’t stop to enjoy the process, **you’ll never feel satisfied.**  

## **The Truth About Success**  

Forget the hustle bros and their rented Lambos. Here’s the real truth:  

- **Most businesses fail before they succeed.**  
- **The ones that make it take years, not months.**  
- **You will doubt yourself.** A lot.  
- **Money doesn’t fix everything.**  

## **What Actually Matters**  

Success isn’t about how fast you can make money. It’s about **building something you actually care about.**  

So stop comparing yourself to the highlight reels of people on social media.  

Stop obsessing over MRR and net worth.  

Instead, ask yourself:  

- **Am I learning?**  
- **Am I making progress, even if it’s slow?**  
- **Am I actually enjoying what I’m building?**  

Because if you hate your life while building your business, **you’re doing it wrong.**
