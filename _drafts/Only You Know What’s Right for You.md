## **Only You Know What’s Right for You**  

As a retired entrepreneur, I’ve had plenty of people tell me what I should do. Friends, family, business partners, even strangers—they all had opinions on how I should live my life. Some of them meant well, some just liked to hear themselves talk. But at the end of the day, I learned one simple truth:  

**Only I know what’s right for me. And the same goes for you.**  

### **Inspiration and Advice Are Useful, But…**  

You can (and should) get inspiration from people you respect. If someone’s living a life that looks good to you, pay attention. Learn from their choices, their mindset, and their habits.  

You can also seek advice from those with experience. A mentor, a trusted friend, or someone who’s been where you want to go can offer valuable insights.  

But here’s the catch—**no one else can decide what’s right for you.**  

What worked for them may not work for you. Their goals, values, and circumstances aren’t the same as yours. Take what resonates and leave the rest.  

### **Be Picky About Who You Listen To**  

Over the years, I’ve learned to be **very selective** about whose advice I take.  

Most people talk from their own fears, biases, and limitations. They’ll tell you to play it safe, to follow the rules, to do what’s “normal.” But if you want a life that’s different from the average, you can’t listen to average advice.  

- **Listen to people who have the results you want.**  
- **Ignore those who just like to talk.**  
- **Trust your gut over the noise.**  

### **No One Knows You Better Than You**  

At the end of the day, you’re the only one who has to live with your decisions. No one else is inside your head. No one else knows what drives you, what excites you, or what truly matters to you.  

So, take in information. Learn from those who inspire you. Get advice from those you respect. But always remember—**it’s your life, and only you can decide what’s right for you.**
