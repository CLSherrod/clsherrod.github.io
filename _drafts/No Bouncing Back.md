# No Bouncing Back

Most self labeled "entrepreneurs" are really gamblers. They go all in to making a business that they have no experience in. Work a huge amount of hours. And get lucky, really learn on the "job" or fail big time. Most people fail big time. And a vast majority never bounce back. They get buried. They lose their business, their house, their love partner, their car and their reputation. It's over for life. They took a gamble and lost.

An early mentor of mine told me to not gamble. Start off slow and only invest more. Only and time based on feedback, as in numbers. What are the critical numbers? Make decisions based on that.
