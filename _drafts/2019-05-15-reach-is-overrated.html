<p>I see so many new entrepreneurs who crave being famous for being an entrepreneur.</p>
<p>So much so they skip the being a successful entrepreneur step and go right into business coaching.</p>
<p>Seth Godin said recently:</p>
<p>"Reach doesn’t matter, because your job isn’t to interrupt people on other planets, with other interests. Your job is to interact with people who care.</p>
<p>Running an ad on the most popular podcast isn’t smart if the most popular podcast reaches people who don’t care about you.</p>
<p>Perhaps it makes sense to pay extra to reach precisely the right people. It never makes sense to pay extra to reach more people."</p>
<p>Focus on getting your message in front of your ideal target audience. No matter how small that is. Just having a #1 podcast doesn't mean you are successful.  Having an audience that totally digs what you are doing is.</p>
