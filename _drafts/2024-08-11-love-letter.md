excerpt: Love letter to my love.
---
I miss see romantic gestures in public. So, besides my poems about love and self-worth. I wrote a love letter to my love.

To my love,

Our love, like the crystals we treasure, has so many facets—each one reflecting a unique and beautiful part of who we are together.

I often think of our meditation sessions, where the world quiets down and it’s just the two of us, breathing in sync, our spirits intertwined. In those moments, I feel an even deeper connection to you, as if our souls are dancing together in a space where only love exists.

I didn’t realize at first that you were the one for me, but when I did, I knew you were the one. We are soulmates, intertwined like Celtic knots, bound by a love that is timeless and unbreakable. Our shared love of crystals has always felt like a symbol of the energy that flows between us—pure, healing, and eternal. I’m reminded of how perfectly we complement each other, balancing one another in the most natural way.

I cherish every moment we share, whether it’s in the serenity of meditation or the quiet joy of simply being near you. You are my greatest treasure, my safe haven, and the love of my life all rolled into one.

Thank you for being my partner, my confidant, my everything. My love for you grows deeper every day, and I am forever grateful that I get to spend my life loving you.

With all my heart,
Chris
