# **How to Stay Positive and Live Peacefully Under a Fascist Regime**  

History has shown us that governments rise and fall, and sometimes, they take a turn for the worse. If you find yourself living under an authoritarian or fascist regime, the instinct may be to panic, resist openly, or sink into despair. But none of those paths will serve you in the long run.  

The key to surviving—and even thriving—under a restrictive government is **staying smart, protecting your peace, and focusing on what you can control**.  

## **Stay Informed, But Don’t Drown in the News**  

One of the easiest ways to lose yourself in fear and frustration is to constantly consume bad news. Yes, you should stay informed, but you don’t need to be glued to every headline.  

Fascist regimes often use **fear and propaganda** to control people. Don’t fall into the trap of giving them your attention 24/7. Instead:  

- **Get your news from international sources.** Local news will often be biased, especially under an authoritarian government. Independent sources from outside your country are more likely to provide a clearer, unbiased perspective.  
- **Limit your consumption.** Checking the news once a day is unnecessary—once or twice a week is enough to stay informed without becoming overwhelmed.  
- **Avoid news videos.** Watching distressing footage can make events feel more personal and immediate, adding unnecessary stress. Reading summaries from reliable sources can keep you informed without triggering an emotional spiral.  
- **Focus on what’s actionable.** Instead of getting lost in outrage, think about what you can actually do.  

The goal is to stay aware without letting negativity consume your daily life.  

## **Master the Art of Quiet Resistance**  

Not every fight needs to be loud. Some of the most effective forms of resistance are silent and strategic.  

- **Build strong local networks.** Trusted friends and community members are your safety net.  
- **Practice self-sufficiency.** Learn skills like gardening, self-defense, and off-grid living.  
- **Protest peacefully with a large, like-minded group.** Strength in numbers reduces individual risk. Participate, make your voice heard, and then **blend back into society** to avoid unnecessary attention.  
- **Don’t make yourself a target.** Speak carefully in public, keep your opinions close, and resist in ways that protect your safety.  

Back in the 1970s, I learned a powerful lesson from my gay friends who lived under intense social scrutiny. They taught me that sometimes, **the best way to survive is to blend in**—to appear normal in public while staying true to yourself in private. They only opened up to those they deeply trusted, ensuring their safety while still being themselves. That same approach applies when living under a restrictive government. You don’t need to put yourself in unnecessary danger to hold onto your beliefs.  

## **Find Joy in Your Daily Life**  

Even under the worst circumstances, life goes on. Governments can control laws, but they can’t control your **mindset**.  

- **Prioritize your mental and physical health.** Exercise, eat well, and get outside.  
- **Engage in hobbies that bring you peace.** Music, reading, writing—whatever keeps you sane.  
- **Surround yourself with people who lift you up.** Stay connected to those who share your values and vision for the future.  

Fascist regimes want you to feel powerless. The ultimate act of defiance is to **stay happy and refuse to live in fear**.  

## **Final Thoughts**  

Living under an oppressive government is challenging, but history proves that **no regime lasts forever**. Stay informed with international news, resist intelligently, and find ways to keep your spirit strong.  

The world is bigger than any government, and **your life is yours to live—no matter who’s in charge**.
