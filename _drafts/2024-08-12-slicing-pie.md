## An Absolute Gem for Entrepreneurs

[The Slicing Pie Handbook](https://amzn.to/3Yy5Ptl) by Mike Moyer explains how to perfectly split up a startup company. It is an absolute gem for anyone involved in the entrepreneurial journey. Having read countless business books over the years, I can confidently say this is one of the best real business books I've ever encountered. I only wish I had discovered it years ago before entering into any business partnerships.

## Addressing Equitable Equity Splits

The book addresses a critical and often overlooked aspect of startups: equitable equity splits. Entrepreneurs and early-stage company participants frequently find themselves at a disadvantage with bad equity deals, which have become the norm rather than the exception. Moyer's framework, based on the dynamic equity model from his earlier book *Slicing Pie*, offers a refreshingly fair and logical approach to equity distribution.

## Lessons Learned

If I knew what is in this book many years ago I would have avoided a situation where I owned a small percentage of a company but all the debt and had no control over sales.

## The Simple Yet Profound Slicing Pie Model

The Slicing Pie model is simple yet profound. It provides a formula to determine the appropriate share for contributors who offer essential resources such as help, equipment, supplies, rent, and even credit. More importantly, it also addresses how to fairly recover equity when someone exits the company. This ensures that the equity splits remain just and reflective of actual contributions over time.

## Practical Application and Accessibility

What sets *The Slicing Pie Handbook* apart is its practical application. Moyer breaks down complex concepts into easily understandable sections, making it accessible for both seasoned entrepreneurs and those new to the startup world. The real-life examples and clear explanations help readers grasp the nuances of equity allocation without getting bogged down in jargon.

## Indispensable for Startups and Small Businesses

If you're involved in a small business or startup with big plans or even considering starting one, this book is indispensable. It will save you from potential pitfalls and provide a roadmap to fair and sustainable equity distribution. *The Slicing Pie Handbook* is not just a guide; it's a toolkit for building stronger, fairer partnerships and ultimately more successful businesses.

## A Must Read

Mike Moyer's [The Slicing Pie Handbook](https://amzn.to/3Yy5Ptl) is a must-read for anyone serious about entrepreneurship. Its fair and practical approach to equity splits is revolutionary and essential for small businesses. Don't start your next venture without it.
