<p>We had a couple of real estate deals close recently.  We gave gifts to the buyer, seller and closer.  People love gifts.  If you have a deal work smoothly then give a gift to the people involved.  You will be amazed at how people react to getting a gift.  One closer was excited and amazed that I was giving her an hour massage and my favorite spa.  Another closer was lukewarm.  She has a problem accepting gifts.  The buyer and sellers were very happy on having the deal done and the gifts they got gave them a smile.  Doing business with me is fun.  You make money, we make money and you get a nice surprise gift.</p>
<p>I like to tie it to production or a deal.  We pay a small percentage out for gifts.  I don't want to be seen as bribing people.  I give them after a deal has paid and I don't promise them or talk about them at all beforehand.  Once it has paid I visit the people I can and personally give it to them.  Others I send it with a personal hand written note.</p>
<p>I want deals to go smoothly and I reward that.</p>
