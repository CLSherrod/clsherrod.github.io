# **Morning Routines Are BS: The Only Way to Get Stuff DONE**  

## **Forget the Cold Plunge, Just Get to Work**  

Before you dive into this article, please go take a cold plunge, journal about your dreamscape, and meditate on your cosmic alignment.  

Or better yet—**don’t do any of that BS.**  

Has anyone else noticed how productivity has turned into a performance? We’ve been sold this idea that success is built on **intricate morning routines, complex task management systems, and productivity hacks** that conveniently come in the form of online courses and eBooks.  

But let’s cut through the noise and get real. **The only thing that gets work done is actually doing the work.**  

## **Stop Organizing. Start Doing.**  

There’s a whole industry designed to make you **feel** productive without actually being productive.  

- Color-coded calendars  
- Digital to-do lists with priority tags and subcategories  
- A dozen work apps sending hourly notifications  
- Endless tweaking of your “workflow”  

Guess what? **None of that gets the real work done.** The more time you spend perfecting your productivity system, the less time you actually spend on the tasks that matter.  

## **The Get to Work Method**  

Here’s a groundbreaking, time-tested productivity system: **Get to work.**  

That’s it. No gimmicks.  

Forget overthinking, optimizing, and prepping for the “perfect” work session. Just sit down and **start at the top of your to-do list.** Then do the next thing. Then the next.  

## **Your To-Do List Should Be Simple**  

Yes, you should have a to-do list.  

But **it should not look like a NASA launch sequence.**  

✅ A simple bullet list? Perfect.  
❌ A complex project board with tags, labels, and dependencies? A waste of time.  

Your to-do list should take seconds to update, **not require a two-hour weekly planning session.** If you spend more time organizing your work than doing it, you’re missing the point.  

## **Stop Worshipping Productivity Gurus**  

There’s a whole breed of influencers selling the idea that **you just need the right system to unlock effortless productivity.** They tell you to **optimize, reflect, and set up the perfect workspace.**  

Reality check: **The most productive people don’t waste time thinking about how to be productive. They just get to work.**  

A crossed-off task on a crumpled sticky note is **infinitely more valuable** than an unchecked box on a perfectly curated digital workflow.  

## **Get to Work and Watch Your Life Change**  

All the planning, journaling, and optimizing in the world won’t move you forward. Only **taking action** will.  

So ditch the complicated routines.  
Stop tweaking your task management app.  
And just **start working.**  

**Get to work. Who’s with me?**
