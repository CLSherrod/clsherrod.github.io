## Summary
Stop optimizing your life and start living
## Title
Why I Stopped Trying to Optimize Everything and Started Living Instead
## Essay
## Chasing Efficiency Nearly Broke Me

Back when I was building businesses, I treated time like a commodity.  
Every minute needed a return.  

I had color-coded calendars, task lists that went on forever, and apps for everything—productivity, meditation, sleep tracking, even when to drink water. I thought if I just dialed in the system tight enough, I’d finally feel on top of life.  

But you know what? I didn’t feel lighter. I felt trapped.  

Like I’d built a cage out of routines, systems, and hacks.  
And the door was locked from the inside.

## The Trap of Optimization

We live in a world obsessed with optimization.  
People are trying to “fix” their lives like it’s some broken machine.  

We shave seconds off routines, track every metric, and call it progress. But what are we rushing toward?  
A better version of ourselves—or just a more efficient ghost of who we used to be?

I remember sitting on the porch one afternoon, watching the sun go down with no phone, no plan, no purpose—just sitting there. And I thought: *This is what I’ve been missing.*  

Not more time, but deeper time.  
Not better productivity, but better presence.

## Waste Time Beautifully

There’s a kind of joy that doesn’t fit on a spreadsheet.  
Like walking aimlessly through a quiet town. Or talking to a stranger in a café just because.  
Moments that don’t scale.  
That don’t need to be captured or shared.  

I used to think doing nothing was lazy. Now I know it’s a skill.  
It takes guts to slow down when the world tells you to speed up.  

Real living happens in the unoptimized corners.  
The late-night talks. The slow mornings. The walks without Fitbits.  
The kind of time you can’t “get back” because you were never trying to hold onto it in the first place.

## It's Not About Cutting Tech—It's About Cutting the Grip

I’m not saying throw your phone in the ocean.  
I still run a business. I still use a computer.  

But I’m more interested in *how* I use these tools—*and what’s using me in return.*  

Digital minimalism isn’t about being a Luddite. It’s about breaking the addiction to metrics, likes, and constant feedback loops that make you feel like you’re never enough.  

It’s about making room for what matters, not what performs.

## The Takeaway: Feel More, Fix Less

Here’s the truth I learned the hard way:  
You don’t need to optimize your life to live it well.  

What you really need is to *feel it.*  

Let it get a little messy. Say yes to things that don’t “make sense.”  
Stop trying to win the productivity game—and start playing the human one.

Because in the end, it’s not about how much you got done.  
It’s about how much of it you actually felt.

And that, my friend, is time well spent.
