## **Forget Perfection—Consistency Is What Really Matters**  

When I was younger, I was obsessed with being the best. I wanted to push myself in everything—work, health, relationships—always striving for the top.  

Now that I’m older, I see things differently.  

I don’t need to be the best. I don’t need trophies, records, or outside validation. What I need is **consistency**—because that’s what actually leads to a fulfilling life.  

### **Consistency Over Burnout**  

When I was younger, I’d overdo things. I’d push myself too hard, whether in business, fitness, or personal growth. And what happened? I’d burn out. I’d take myself out for days, weeks, or even longer.  

Now, I pace myself.  

- In my **health**, I focus on what I can sustain long-term, not crash diets or extreme workouts.  
- In my **business**, I prioritize steady effort over chasing quick wins.  
- In my **relationships**, I show up consistently instead of making grand gestures and disappearing.  

It’s not about going full speed—it’s about showing up **again and again** without burning out.  

### **The Real Priorities in Life**  

I no longer chase perfection. Instead, I focus on what actually makes life good:  

- **Health** – I need the energy to enjoy life.  
- **Wealth** – I need financial security to have freedom.  
- **Relationships** – I need family and friends to share experiences with.  
- **Skills & Practice** – I need to keep learning and growing in what I enjoy.  

I don’t need to be the best at any of these things. I just need to be **consistent** enough to enjoy them.  

### **Enjoying the Present**  

When you stop obsessing over being the best, you start living in the moment. You stop chasing, and you start appreciating.  

I don’t need to win anything. I just want to wake up, do what I love, spend time with good people, and enjoy these precious moments while they last.  

Because, at the end of the day, life isn’t about being the best—it’s about actually **living**.
