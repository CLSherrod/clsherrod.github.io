# Navigating the Challenge of Working with Newbie Dreamer Entrepreneurs

The entrepreneurial landscape is vast and varied, brimming with individuals who harbor dreams of success and innovation. However, there's a marked difference between those who dream and those who act, making the journey of guiding newbie dreamer entrepreneurs a complex one.

### **The Problem with Dreamers**

Many novice entrepreneurs start their journey with immense passion and a vision that seems unshakeable. Guiding such individuals, while inspiring, presents unique challenges for mentors and advisors.

1. **Unrealistic Expectations:** Many dreamers harbor unrealistic goals. While optimism is essential, overconfidence without groundwork often sets them up for disappointment. As a mentor, you find yourself constantly walking the tightrope – motivating them, yet grounding their expectations in reality.

2. **Blame Game:** Failure is an inevitable part of any entrepreneurial journey. Yet, many newbie dreamers, when faced with their first taste of failure, resort to placing blame elsewhere, often on those who've guided them. This places mentors in a defensive position, where they must shield not just their reputation but also protect other mentees from such negativity.

3. **Protective Measures:** The onus often falls on the mentor to implement protective measures, ensuring that one individual's disillusionment doesn't affect the morale of the entire cohort. This sometimes means taking an aggressive stance to safeguard the broader group's interests.

### **The Advantage of the Experienced**

Given the challenges posed by dreamer entrepreneurs, many mentors, like myself, have come to prefer working with individuals who've already tasted both success and failure. These individuals:

1. **Are Grounded:** Having experienced the highs and lows of entrepreneurial endeavors, they are realistic about their goals, the effort required, and potential pitfalls.

2. **Know Their Path:** They are more decisive, knowing clearly what they seek from mentorship. This clarity aids in crafting more effective guidance strategies tailored to their specific needs.

3. **Offer Mutual Growth:** Such entrepreneurs often come with insights and experiences that can be enlightening even for mentors. The relationship becomes a two-way street, ensuring mutual growth.

### **The Danger of Exploiting Dreamers**

Given the naive enthusiasm of many dreamer entrepreneurs, there exists a dark side to mentoring – the potential to exploit. Some, seeing an opportunity, might sell subpar services, products, or advice, capitalizing on a dreamer's optimism. This not only damages the dreamer's prospects but also taint s the broader entrepreneurial ecosystem.

Moreover, painting genuine, hard-working entrepreneurs with the broad brush of "losers" just because they're new and enthusiastic is detrimental. It creates a negative narrative that can stifle genuine talent and passion.

### **In Conclusion**

The entrepreneurial journey is a marathon, not a sprint. While dreamer entrepreneurs come with their set of challenges, it's essential to remember that today's dreamers can be tomorrow's innovators. As mentors, our role is to guide, nurture, and sometimes protect, ensuring that each individual, whether a newbie dreamer or a seasoned entrepreneur, gets the right environment to thrive.

Choosing to work with experienced individuals might make the journey smoother, but the ecosystem thrives on diversity. It's this mix of naivety, experience, passion, and resilience that drives innovation, ensuring the entrepreneurial world remains dynamic and ever-evolving.
