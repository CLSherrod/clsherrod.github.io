<p>I recently had a business deal not work out.</p>
<p>The person I was working with hit the nuclear button and made up things in order to win the argument why they should keep $2000.</p>
<p>Making up photos to prove their point and when that didn't work threatened a family member.</p>
<p>Anything to keep the money and blame me to justify.</p>
<p>I sat back and thought about what happened.</p>
<p>Was there a sign that I missed?</p>
<p>What other deals that were similar how were they similar?</p>
<p>All of the deals didn't work out because the client, partner or contractor was desperate for money.</p>
<p>When people are desperate and can't afford to not get the money they will a vast majority of the time make up a story to convince themselves that they are the victim and are being screwed over.</p>
<p>No amount of contract paperwork, pictures, correspondence, and facts will convince them that they have made a mistake. They can't live with being wrong. So they hit the nuclear button and will take you down and ruin your reputation in order to win.</p>
<p>You can never win with desperate people.</p>
<p>I've found it best to state your position and then move on or hand it to a lawyer if serious.</p>
