excerpt: Back in 1999 I gave up. I was consulting with a company that went out of
  business in one split second. I was stuck in a foreign country the day before getting

<p>Back in 1999 I gave up. I was consulting with a company that went out of business in one split second. I was stuck in a foreign country the day before getting paid my monthly fee.  It sucked. Plus it was right before Y2K and no one was hiring for projects. Hell, I couldn't even move as no one was moving and there were no where to move to.</p>
<p>So I stayed at my Uncle's place out in the country in Nevada and waited it out. Y2K came out to be a complete joke but I didn't recover for years.</p>

<p>When I found my own song things clicked and I love working with people that have a passion and want to make a noise with it.</p>
