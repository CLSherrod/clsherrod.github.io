<p>Here is a good story of reaching for your dreams.</p>
<blockquote><p>Once upon a time there was a bunch of tiny frogs.... who arranged a running competition.</p>
<p>The goal was to reach the top of a very high tower.</p>
<p>A big crowd had gathered around the tower to see the race and cheer on the contestants....</p>
<p>The race began....</p>
<p>Honestly, no one in the crowd really believed that the tiny frogs would reach the top of the tower.</p>
<p>You heard statements such as:</p>
<p>"Oh, WAY too difficult!!"</p>
<p>"They will NEVER make it to the top."</p>
<p>or:</p>
<p>"Not a chance that they will succeed. The tower is too high!"</p>
<p>The tiny frogs began collapsing. One by one....</p>
<p>Except for those, who in a fresh tempo, were climbing higher and higher....</p>
<p>The crowd continued to yell,   "It is too difficult!!! No one will make it!"</p>
<p>More tiny frogs got tired and gave up....</p>
<p>But ONE continued higher and higher and higher....</p>
<p>This one wouldn't give up!</p>
<p>At the end everyone else had given up climbing the tower. Except for the one tiny frog who, after a big effort, was the only one who reached the top!</p>
<p>THEN all of the other tiny frogs naturally wanted to know how this one frog managed to do it?</p>
<p>A contestant asked the tiny frog how he had found the strength to succeed and reach the goal?</p>
<p>It turned out....That the winner was DEAF!!!!</p>
<p>The wisdom of this story is:</p>
<p>Never listen to other people's tendencies to be negative or pessimistic....  because they take your most wonderful dreams and<br />
wishes away from you -- the ones you have in your heart!</p>
<p>Always think of the power words have, because everything you hear and read will affect your actions!</p>
<p>Therefore:</p>
<p>ALWAYS be....POSITIVE!</p>
<p>And above all: Be DEAF when people tell YOU that you cannot fulfill your dreams!</p>
<p>Always think: God and I can do this!</p>
<p>If you fall down 10 times,<br />
Stand up 11.</p></blockquote>
<p>Don't listen to negatives around you.Â  And just do it.</p>
