<p>Most successful people have ten traits that, when combined, can turn dreams into reality.</p>
<p>1. How you think is everything.  Always be positive. Think success, not failure. Beware of a negative environment.</p>
<p>2. Decide upon your true dreams and goals.  Write down your specific goals and develop a plan to reach them.</p>
<p>3. Take action.  Goals are nothing without action. Don%u2019t be afraid to get started. Just do it.</p>
<p>4. Never stop learning.  Go back to school or read books. Get training and acquire skills.</p>
<p>5. Be persistent and work hard.  Success is a marathon, not a sprint. Never give up.</p>
<p>6. Learn to analyze details.  Get all the facts, all the input. Learn from your mistakes.</p>
<p>7. Focus your time and money.  Don’t let other people or things distract you.</p>
<p>8. Don%u2019t be afraid to innovate; be different.  Following the herd is a sure way to mediocrity.</p>
<p>9. Deal and communicate with people effectively.  No person is an island. Learn to understand and motivate others.</p>
<p>10. Be honest and dependable; take responsibility.  Otherwise, numbers 1-9 won’t matter.</p>
