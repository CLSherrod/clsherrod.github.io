I loved this article about creating your life like an opus.Â  Make sure you read the entire article by clicking on the link below, excerpt follows.</p>
>Most people want to live a fulfilling and rewarding life. That's why there's no shortage of self-help materials on how to set goals and design an ideal life. However, even with the plethora of information available on how to create the life of your dreams, many people still feel dissatisfied and unable to reach key goals they've outlined for themselves. What are these people missing?

The key is to know how to turn your goals into performance. A great analogy is to think in terms of creating your own life's Opus. Why an Opus? Because that's what you are capable of. Some dictionaries define an Opus as the most brilliant composition a music composer creates in a lifetime. You are your own instrument and you create your personal symphony by what you do in your life. Realize that you have unlimited potential and that anything is possible. Your personal symphony can be grand. It can be colorful. It can be inspiring. You can choose it to be anything you like. Therefore, your personal Opus is really about taking your life and creating the most incredible and awesome legacy that is within you-that's how your goals become reality.</p></blockquote>
