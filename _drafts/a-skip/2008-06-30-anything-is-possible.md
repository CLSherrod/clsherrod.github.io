I'm traveling today.  Going to France and Venice Italy for six weeks.  By the time you read this I'll be on a jet in business class having champagne with my honey Nan.  I'll keep everyone up to date on what I'm visiting. I'm a photographer so I'll be posting my photos on an almost daily basis.

I love to travel and I love people's travel blogs. My favorite being Where the Hell is Matt? Matt has released a new video of his travels around the world dancing in front of the video camera. Take a look.

This just shows that anything is possible.  He has a sponsor that pays for his travels and then he comes out with a video and the sponsor gets exposure.  Anything is possible. Just find a way to do what you want to do.

I love to travel and I love my business. Since we are doing home exchanges with only places that have high-speed Internet I can work while in another country. I'm working on three different clients website at the moment and any changes can be done by me or my team while I'm anywhere in the world.

In fact business is booming. But, I've noticed that I'm more productive when I'm not home.  I get more done and I get to see fabulous places. I also get great ideas. Travel is my favorite way to get ideas.  I talk about it in my book <a href="https://amzn.to/2q38olf">How To Create new Business Ideas Based On What You Love</a> a lot.

Don't let your business get in the way of enjoying life  In fact, find that enjoying life makes your business better.
