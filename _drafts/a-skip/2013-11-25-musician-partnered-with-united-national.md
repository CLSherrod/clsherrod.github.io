Here is a sign that electronic music is mainstream.<br />
 *David Guetta is turning to Twitter for a good cause. The international DJ/producer has partnered with the United Nations for "The World Needs More. . ." campaign to help raise money for humanitarian needs around the world. Guetta and other global brands have sponsored words meaningful to them; each time that word is tweeted, $1 is unlocked for aid efforts. *

Here's the music video

Things have come along way for electronic music. I use to be the only one that I knew of that liked it. Now David Guetta is teaming with the United Nations. Can't get much bigger than that. And major pop artists are teaming with electronic dance artists to get in front a new audience.

And this is why David is one of my favorite artists.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"> *With album titles like Just a Little More Love and One Love under his belt, it's no surprise that Guetta has sponsored the word '#Love.' "There's been a lot of my songs about love and that's the kind of person that I am," he told Rolling Stone. "It's the biggest energy in the world. Universal love. Have a little bit of compassion and love for each other. Some people might find it cheesy, I don't think that it is." *

I don't find it cheesy either and why I work on my music everyday with my motto #AboveAllIsLove

I <a href="https://twitter.com/ChrisSherrod/status/405004196577280001">tweeted about it this morning</a>. Come join me and David Guetta, United Nations and the rest of the world.
