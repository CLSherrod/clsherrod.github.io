>You will adopt the ideas, beliefs, and mindset of the people you spend the most time with (including the people found on TV, in books, or on tape), which will lead you to make similar decisions, which will lead you to assume a similar life and lifestyle.

Rich people know this, and they know that a person's mindset is fluid. It's always changing with the ideas and interactions it comes into contact with on a daily basis.

This is why rich people protect themselves from everything associated with struggle and poverty.

Ever wonder why they live together in walled communities closed off from the rest of society with massive gates? Ever wonder why they shop at expensive boutiques, fly first-class, stay at $500/night hotels?

Ever wonder why most of them belong to "members only" country clubs?

Is it because they want to enjoy the finer things in life? Well sure. But that's not the only reason.

They want to protect their minds from the thoughts of poverty and struggle that are held by the rest of common society because they know that all thoughts are contagious, and they have a burning desire to live un-common lives.

The rich get richer because they only invite and interact with other prosperous people.

The common man sees this behavior as "stuck-up" and "snobby". The rich simple see it as an unfortunate necessity, as I do.</blockquote>
