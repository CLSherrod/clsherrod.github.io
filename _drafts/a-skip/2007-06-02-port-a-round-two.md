  I'm just back from another vacation.

  I had a realization this week that my life is really wonderful.  This is my second week long vacation in a month.  I regularly take off weekends and I enjoy life.  I'm doing what I love and teach people how to create ideas based on what they love.

<p>I had a realization this week that my life is really wonderful.  This is my second week long vacation in a month.  I regularly take off weekends and I enjoy life.  I'm doing what I love and teach people how to create ideas based on what they love.</p>
<p>Some people I have been looking up to as mentors work all the time.  I don't want to work all the time.  I've done that and I'm grateful I'm still alive.  I love life.  It's not about how much money I make, it's about my lifestyle and doing what I want to do.</p>
<p>Many people focus on how much money they want.  "I want to be a triillionaire".  Why?  Money is a tool to help get you want you want.  I love to travel.  I love adventure.  I love excitement.  Money helps get me all that.  You can't do it with a standard salary or schedule.  But, why replace a job with a schedule of working all the time, especially if you have enough money to do anything you want?  I don't personally understand it.  They seem to focus only on the money.  I don't.  I put out products and services that I feel passionate about and people know it.  I do set a goal of how much money to make for each project, that is what a business does.</p>
<p>I want to change people's lives and have fun.  So I focus on that.</p>
<p>Picture is of some pelicans.  I have got some great video of dolphins which I'll post later.</p>
