Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Template

Why: This template is a generic template for creating SOPs. It helps define the formatting and organization guidelines of a SOP so that we have a standard format. This makes it easy for anyone in the company to understand SOPs from other parts of the company and for the new guys to get up to speed quick, fast and in a hurry so they can get to the fun part of helping us grow the company
When: Whenever you create a new SOP, use the guidelines outlined here and in the Creating SOPs SOP
Where: All our SOPs are run out of Google Drive
Who: Anyone making or updating a SOP
